"Posterior cortical atrophy symptoms vary among people. Symptoms also can vary over time. They tend to gradually get worse. Common symptoms include having trouble with:  Reading, spelling or math. Driving. Getting dressed. Telling the difference between objects that are moving and those that are still. Judging how far away objects are. Using everyday objects or tools. Identifying left from right.  Other common symptoms include:  Anxiety. Confusion. Changes in behavior and personality.  Memory problems may occur later in the disease. Causes The most common cause of posterior cortical atrophy is a form of Alzheimer's disease that's not typical. It affects the back of the brain. Other less common causes include corticobasal degeneration, Lewy body dementia and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Researchers are looking at potential gene variations that may be related to the condition.

"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) affects many parts of your body. Symptoms usually start in adulthood, usually in the 50s or 60s. There are two types of MSA: parkinsonian and cerebellar. The type depends on the symptoms you have when you're diagnosed. MSA Parkinsonian type This is the most common type of MSA. The signs and symptoms are similar to those of Parkinson's disease, such as: MSA  Stiff muscles Difficulty bending your arms and legs Slow movement (bradykinesia) Tremors can occur at rest or when moving your arms or legs Soft voice Problems with posture and balance  Cerebellar type The main signs and symptoms are problems with muscle coordination (ataxia), but others may include:  Impaired movement and coordination, such as unsteady gait and loss of balance Slurred, slow or low-volume speech (dysarthria) Visual disturbances, such as blurred or double vision and difficulty focusing your eyes Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) or chewing Changes in speech, such as slurred speech   General signs and symptoms In addition, the primary sign of multiple system atrophy is autonomic failure, which may cause problems with body functions you can't control. This may include: Postural (orthostatic) hypotension Postural hypotension is a form of low blood pressure that makes you feel dizzy or lightheaded, or even faint, when you stand up from sitting or lying down. Not everyone with MSA has postural hypotension. MSA You can also develop dangerously high blood pressure levels while lying down (supine hypertension). Urinary and bowel dysfunction  Constipation Loss of bladder or bowel control (incontinence)  Changes in sweat production  Producing less sweat Heat intolerance due to reduced sweating Impaired body temperature control, often causing cold hands or feet  Sleep disorders  Agitated sleep due to ""acting out"" dreams Abnormal breathing at night or a harsh breathing sound (stridor)  Sexual dysfunction  Inability to achieve or maintain an erection (impotence) Loss of libido  Cardiovascular problems  Color changes in hands and feet caused by pooling of blood  Psychiatric problems  Difficulty controlling emotions, such as laughing or crying inappropriately ",654.0,"['multiple system atrophy (msa) affects parts body', ' symptoms start adulthood', ' 50s 60s', ' types msa: parkinsonian cerebellar', "" type depends symptoms you're diagnosed"", ' msa parkinsonian type common type msa', "" signs symptoms similar parkinson's disease"", ' as: msa  stiff muscles difficulty bending arms legs slow movement (bradykinesia) tremors can occur rest moving arms legs soft voice problems posture balance  cerebellar type signs symptoms problems muscle coordination (ataxia)', ' may include:  impaired movement coordination', ' unsteady gait loss balance slurred', ' slow low-volume speech (dysarthria) visual disturbances', ' blurred double vision difficulty focusing eyes difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) chewing changes speech', ' slurred speech   general signs symptoms addition', ' primary sign multiple system atrophy autonomic failure', "" may cause problems body functions can't control"", ' may include: postural (orthostatic) hypotension postural hypotension form low blood pressure makes feel dizzy lightheaded', ' faint', ' stand sitting lying down', ' msa postural hypotension', ' msa can develop dangerously high blood pressure levels lying down (supine hypertension)', ' urinary bowel dysfunction  constipation loss bladder bowel control (incontinence)  changes sweat production  producing sweat heat intolerance due reduced sweating impaired body temperature control', ' causing cold hands feet  sleep disorders  agitated sleep due ""acting out"" dreams abnormal breathing night harsh breathing sound (stridor)  sexual dysfunction  inability achieve maintain erection (impotence) loss libido  cardiovascular problems  color changes hands feet caused pooling blood  psychiatric problems  difficulty controlling emotions', ' laughing crying inappropriately ']",['multiple system atrophy']

"A popliteal artery aneurysm may not cause any noticeable symptoms. The first symptom may be pain the lower leg that occurs with walking (claudication). Other signs and symptoms of a popliteal artery aneurysm include:   Knee pain Lower leg pain Swelling behind the knee Pulsing sensation behind the knee  Causes An aneurysm is a ballooning in a weak spot in an artery wall. Many different things can cause the popliteal artery wall to become weak, including:  Clogged arteries (atherosclerosis) High blood pressure Wear and tear of the popliteal artery due to repetitive use of the knee joint Weakening of the artery wall  Risk factors Popliteal artery aneurysms are rare. They are more common in men than in women. Popiteal artery aneurysms often occur in men with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a swelling of the wall of the body's main artery (aorta). Anyone diagnosed with popliteal artery aneurysm should be screened for AAA. AAA Other risk factors for popliteal artery aneurysm include:  Increasing age High blood pressure (hypertension) Smoking Narrowing of a heart valve (stenotic disease) Having three or more aneurysms anywhere in the body  Complications Complications of popliteal artery aneurysm include blood clots (thrombosis) and, rarely, rupture of the aneurysm. Thrombosis of a popliteal artery aneurysm can cause a severe lack of blood flow (ischemia) in the lower leg, which may result in loss of the limb. Sudden leg ischemia can cause the following signs and symptoms:  A change in skin color in the affected area No pulse behind the knee Skin in the affected area feels cold Numbness in the leg Inability to move the foot  The risk of popliteal artery aneurysm rupture is low. Prevention Smoking and high blood pressure (hypertension) increase the risk of blood vessel (vascular) problems that can lead to popliteal artery and other aneurysms. Following a heart-healthy lifestyle — such as not smoking, eating a nutritious diet and getting regular exercise — can help prevent heart disease and blood vessel damage.

"The severity of fetal alcohol syndrome symptoms varies, with some children experiencing them to a far greater degree than others. Signs and symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome may include any mix of physical defects, intellectual or cognitive disabilities, and problems functioning and coping with daily life. Physical defects Physical defects may include:  Distinctive facial features, including small eyes, an exceptionally thin upper lip, a short, upturned nose, and a smooth skin surface between the nose and upper lip Deformities of joints, limbs and fingers Slow physical growth before and after birth Vision difficulties or hearing problems Small head circumference and brain size Heart defects and problems with kidneys and bones  Brain and central nervous system problemsProblems with the brain and central nervous system may include:  Poor coordination or balance Intellectual disability, learning disorders and delayed development Poor memory Trouble with attention and with processing information Difficulty with reasoning and problem-solving Difficulty identifying consequences of choices Poor judgment skills Jitteriness or hyperactivity Rapidly changing moods  Social and behavioral issuesProblems in functioning, coping and interacting with others may include:  Difficulty in school Trouble getting along with others Poor social skills Trouble adapting to change or switching from one task to another Problems with behavior and impulse control Poor concept of time Problems staying on task Difficulty planning or working toward a goal  When to see a doctorIf you're pregnant and can't stop drinking, ask your obstetrician, primary care doctor or mental health professional for help. Because early diagnosis may help reduce the risk of long-term problems for children with fetal alcohol syndrome, let your child's doctor know if you drank alcohol while you were pregnant. Don't wait for problems to arise before seeking help.

Children with this form often do not survive beyond childhood. Juvenile form. This is the second most common form and starts in children between 3 and 16 years of age. Early signs are behavior and cognitive problems and increasing difficulty in school. Loss of the ability to walk may occur. Although the juvenile form doesn't progress as fast as the late infantile form, survival is generally less than 20 years after symptoms begin. Adult form. This form is less common and typically starts after age 16. Signs progress slowly and may begin with behavior and psychiatric problems, drug and alcohol misuse, and issues with school and work.

Siblings, even identical twins, with the disease can have different levels of severity. Some people who have Gaucher disease have only mild or no symptoms. Most people who have Gaucher disease have varying degrees of the following problems:  Abdominal complaints.

Gaucher disease can weaken bone, increasing the risk of painful fractures. It can also interfere with the blood supply to your bones, which can cause portions of the bone to die. Blood disorders. A decrease in healthy red blood cells (anemia) can result in severe fatigue. Gaucher disease also affects the cells responsible for clotting, which can cause easy bruising and nosebleeds.

"In the U.S., because of newborn screening, cystic fibrosis can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms develop. But people born before newborn screening became available may not be diagnosed until the signs and symptoms of CF show up. CF Cystic fibrosis signs and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease. Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or improve as time passes. Some people may not experience symptoms until their teenage years or adulthood. People who are not diagnosed until adulthood usually have milder disease and are more likely to have atypical symptoms, such as recurring bouts of an inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), infertility and recurring pneumonia. People with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other signs and symptoms of CF affect the respiratory system and digestive system. CF Respiratory signs and symptoms The thick and sticky mucus associated with cystic fibrosis clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. This can cause signs and symptoms such as:  A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum) Wheezing Exercise intolerance Repeated lung infections Inflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose Recurrent sinusitis  Digestive signs and symptoms The thick mucus can also block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your small intestine. Without these digestive enzymes, your intestines aren't able to completely absorb the nutrients in the food you eat.

"An indication of simple absence seizure is a vacant stare, which may be mistaken for a lapse in attention that lasts about 10 seconds, though it may last as long as 20 seconds, without any confusion, headache or drowsiness afterward. Signs and symptoms of absence seizures include:  Sudden stop in motion without falling Lip smacking Eyelid flutters Chewing motions Finger rubbing Small movements of both hands  Afterward, there's no memory of the incident. Some people have many episodes daily, which interfere with school or daily activities. A child may have absence seizures for some time before an adult notices the seizures, because they're so brief. A decline in a child's learning ability may be the first sign of this disorder. Teachers may comment about a child's inability to pay attention or that a child is often daydreaming.

Hypogonadism can begin during fetal development, before puberty or during adulthood. Signs and symptoms depend on when the condition develops. Fetal development If the body doesn't produce enough testosterone during fetal development, the result may be impaired growth of the external sex organs. Depending on when hypogonadism develops and how much testosterone is present, a child who is genetically male may be born with:  Female genitals Genitals that are neither clearly male nor clearly female (ambiguous genitals) Underdeveloped male genitals  Puberty Male hypogonadism can delay puberty or cause incomplete or lack of normal development. It can hamper:  Development of muscle mass Voice deepening Growth of body and facial hair Growth of the penis and testicles  And it can cause:  Excessive growth of the arms and legs in relation to the trunk of the body Development of breast tissue (gynecomastia)  Adulthood In adult males, hypogonadism can alter certain masculine physical characteristics and impair normal reproductive function. Early signs and symptoms might include:  Decreased sex drive Decreased energy Depression  Over time, men with hypogonadism can develop:  Erectile dysfunction Infertility Decrease in hair growth on the face and body Decrease in muscle mass Development of breast tissue (gynecomastia) Loss of bone mass (osteoporosis)  Severe hypogonadism can also cause mental and emotional changes. As testosterone decreases, some men have symptoms similar to those of menopause in women. These can include:  Difficulty concentrating Hot flashes  When to seek help See your health care provider if you have symptoms of male hypogonadism.

"Migraines, which affect children and teenagers as well as adults, can progress through four stages: prodrome, aura, attack and post-drome. Not everyone who has migraines goes through all stages. Prodrome One or two days before a migraine, you might notice subtle changes that warn of an upcoming migraine, including:  Constipation Mood changes, from depression to euphoria Food cravings Neck stiffness Increased urination Fluid retention Frequent yawning  Aura For some people, an aura might occur before or during migraines. Auras are reversible symptoms of the nervous system. They're usually visual but can also include other disturbances. Each symptom usually begins gradually, builds up over several minutes and can last up to 60 minutes. Examples of migraine auras include:  Visual phenomena, such as seeing various shapes, bright spots or flashes of light Vision loss Pins and needles sensations in an arm or leg Weakness or numbness in the face or one side of the body Difficulty speaking  Attack A migraine usually lasts from 4 to 72 hours if untreated. How often migraines occur varies from person to person. Migraines might occur rarely or strike several times a month. During a migraine, you might have:  Pain usually on one side of your head, but often on both sides Pain that throbs or pulses Sensitivity to light, sound, and sometimes smell and touch Nausea and vomiting  Post-drome After a migraine attack, you might feel drained, confused and washed out for up to a day.

Some infants need to spend time in a unit that cares for them and closely tracks their health day and night. This is called a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). A step down from the NICU is an intermediate care nursery, which provides less intensive care. Special nursery units are staffed with health care providers and a team that's trained to help preterm babies. NICU Your baby may need extra help feeding and adapting right after delivery.

Signs and symptoms of scrotal masses vary depending on the abnormality. Signs and symptoms might include:  An unusual lump   Sudden pain   A dull aching pain or feeling of heaviness in the scrotum   Pain that radiates throughout the groin, abdomen or lower back   Tender, swollen or hardened testicle   Tender, swollen or hardened epididymis (ep-ih-DID-uh-miss), the soft, comma-shaped tube above and behind the testicle that stores and transports sperm   Swelling in the scrotum   Redness of the skin of the scrotum   Nausea or vomiting   If the cause of a scrotal mass is an infection, signs and symptoms also might include: Fever   Urinary frequency   Pus or blood in the urine  When to see a doctor Seek emergency medical care if you develop sudden pain in your scrotum. Some conditions require prompt treatment to avoid permanent damage to a testicle. See your doctor if you detect a lump in your scrotum, even if it's not painful or tender, or if you experience other symptoms of a scrotal mass. Some scrotal masses are more common in children. See your doctor if your child experiences symptoms of a scrotal mass, if you have any concerns about the development of the genitals or if a testicle is “missing” — an undescended or retractile testicle, which might increase the risk of some scrotal masses later in life.",889.0,"['           male reproductive system       open pop-up dialog box          close    male reproductive system   male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', '               male reproductive system       open pop-up dialog box           male reproductive system       open pop-up dialog box  open pop-up dialog box       close    male reproductive system   male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', '          close    male reproductive system   male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', '        close    male reproductive system   male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', '     close    close  close male reproductive system   male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', '  male reproductive system male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', ' male reproductive system makes', ' stores moves sperm', ' testicles produce sperm', ' fluid seminal vesicles prostate gland combine sperm semen', ' penis ejaculates semen sexual intercourse', ' signs symptoms scrotal masses vary depending abnormality', ' signs symptoms include:  unusual lump   sudden pain   dull aching pain feeling heaviness scrotum   pain radiates groin', ' abdomen lower back   tender', ' swollen hardened testicle   tender', ' swollen hardened epididymis (ep-ih-did-uh-miss)', ' soft', ' comma-shaped tube testicle stores transports sperm   swelling scrotum   redness skin scrotum   nausea vomiting   cause scrotal mass infection', ' signs symptoms include: fever   urinary frequency   pus blood urine  see doctor seek emergency medical care develop sudden pain scrotum', ' conditions require prompt treatment avoid permanent damage testicle', ' see doctor detect lump scrotum', "" it's painful tender"", ' experience symptoms scrotal mass', ' scrotal masses common children', ' see doctor child experiences symptoms scrotal mass', ' concerns development genitals testicle “missing” — undescended retractile testicle', ' increase risk scrotal masses later life', '']",['scrotal masses']

"Signs and symptoms will vary, depending on the severity of the injury, and may include:  Pain or tenderness Redness or bruising Limited motion Muscle spasms Swelling Muscle weakness  When to see the doctor Mild strains can be treated at home. See a doctor if your symptoms worsen despite treatment — especially if your pain becomes intolerable, or you experience numbness or tingling. Causes Acute strains can be caused by one event, such as using poor body mechanics to lift something heavy. Chronic muscle strains can result from repetitive injuries when you stress a muscle by doing the same motion over and over. Risk factors Participating in contact sports — such as soccer, football, hockey, boxing and wrestling — can increase your risk of muscle strains. Certain parts of the body are more susceptible to strains during participation in certain sports. Examples include:  Legs and ankles. Sports that feature quick starts and jumping, such as hurdling and basketball, can be particularly tough on the Achilles tendon in your ankle. Hands. Gripping sports, such as gymnastics or golf, can increase your risk of muscle strains in your hands. Elbows. Elbow strains are often caused by throwing sports and racquet sports.  Prevention Regular stretching and strengthening exercises for your sport, fitness or work activity, as part of an overall physical conditioning program, can help to minimize your risk of muscle strains. Try to be in shape to play your sport; don't play your sport to get in shape. If you have a physically demanding occupation, regular conditioning can help prevent injuries.

It can come on suddenly or gradually and affect just your scalp or your whole body. Signs and symptoms of hair loss may include:  Gradual thinning on top of head. This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting people as they age. In men, hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead. Women typically have a broadening of the part in their hair. An increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women is a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia). Circular or patchy bald spots. Some people lose hair in circular or patchy bald spots on the scalp, beard or eyebrows. Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out. Sudden loosening of hair. A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary. Full-body hair loss. Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. The hair usually grows back. Patches of scaling that spread over the scalp. This is a sign of ringworm. It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling and, at times, oozing.

Women may also have symptoms such as:  Discomfort in the neck, jaw, teeth or back Nausea Shortness of breath Stabbing pain instead of chest pressure Stomach (abdominal) pain ",52.0,"['           heart attack       open pop-up dialog box          close    heart attack   heart attack heart attack occurs artery supplying heart blood oxygen blocked', ' fatty deposits build time', "" forming plaques heart's arteries"", ' plaque ruptures', ' blood clot can form block arteries', ' causing heart attack', ' heart attack', "" tissue heart muscle dies due lack blood flow heart's arteries"", '               heart attack       open pop-up dialog box           heart attack       open pop-up dialog box  open pop-up dialog box       close    heart attack   heart attack heart attack occurs artery supplying heart blood oxygen blocked', ' fatty deposits build time', "" forming plaques heart's arteries"", ' plaque ruptures', ' blood clot can form block arteries', ' causing heart attack', ' heart attack', "" tissue heart muscle dies due lack blood flow heart's arteries"", '          close    heart attack   heart attack heart attack occurs artery supplying heart blood oxygen blocked', ' fatty deposits build time', "" forming plaques heart's arteries"", ' plaque ruptures', ' blood clot can form block arteries', ' causing heart attack', ' heart attack', "" tissue heart muscle dies due lack blood flow heart's arteries"", '        close    heart attack   heart attack heart attack occurs artery supplying heart blood oxygen blocked', ' fatty deposits build time', "" forming plaques heart's arteries"", ' plaque ruptures', ' blood clot can form block arteries', ' causing heart attack', ' heart attack', "" tissue heart muscle dies due lack blood flow heart's arteries"", '     close    close  close heart attack   heart attack heart attack occurs artery supplying heart blood oxygen blocked', ' fatty deposits build time', "" forming plaques heart's arteries"", ' plaque ruptures', ' blood clot can form block arteries', ' causing heart attack', ' heart attack', "" tissue heart muscle dies due lack blood flow heart's arteries"", '  heart attack heart attack occurs artery supplying heart blood oxygen blocked', ' fatty deposits build time', "" forming plaques heart's arteries"", ' plaque ruptures', ' blood clot can form block arteries', ' causing heart attack', ' heart attack', "" tissue heart muscle dies due lack blood flow heart's arteries"", ' heart attack occurs artery supplying heart blood oxygen blocked', ' fatty deposits build time', "" forming plaques heart's arteries"", ' plaque ruptures', ' blood clot can form block arteries', ' causing heart attack', ' heart attack', "" tissue heart muscle dies due lack blood flow heart's arteries"", ' angina symptoms include chest pain discomfort', ' chest pain discomfort may feel like:  burning fullness pressure squeezing  pain may felt arms', ' neck', ' jaw', ' shoulder back', '  symptoms angina include:  dizziness fatigue nausea shortness breath sweating  severity', ' duration type angina can vary', ' new symptoms may signal dangerous form angina (unstable angina) heart attack', ' new worsening angina symptoms need evaluated health care provider who can determine stable unstable angina', ' angina women symptoms angina women can classic angina symptoms', ' differences may lead delays seeking treatment', ' example', ' chest pain common symptom women angina', ' may only symptom prevalent symptom women', ' women may symptoms as:  discomfort neck', ' jaw', ' teeth back nausea shortness breath stabbing pain chest pressure stomach (abdominal) pain ']",['angina']

"Signs and symptoms will vary, depending on the severity of the greenstick fracture. Mild fractures might be mistaken for sprains or bruises. More-severe greenstick fractures may cause an obvious deformity, accompanied by significant pain and swelling. When to see a doctor Contact your doctor if your child has persistent pain in an injured limb. Seek immediate medical attention if a child is unable to bear weight or if there is obvious pain, deformity and swelling. Causes Childhood fractures most commonly occur with a fall. Arm fractures are more common than leg fractures, since the common reaction is to throw out your arms to catch yourself when you fall. Risk factors The risk of greenstick fractures is higher in young children because their bones are softer and more flexible than adult bones. In a greenstick fracture, the bone bends and cracks instead of breaking into separate pieces. Most greenstick fractures occur in children under age 10.

"Signs and symptoms of trachoma usually affect both eyes and may include:  Mild itching and irritation of the eyes and eyelids Eye discharge containing mucus or pus Eyelid swelling Light sensitivity (photophobia) Eye pain Eye redness Vision loss  Young children are particularly susceptible to infection. But the disease progresses slowly, and the more painful symptoms may not emerge until adulthood.  The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified five stages in the development of trachoma:  Inflammation — follicular. The early infection has five or more follicles — small bumps that contain lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell — visible with magnification on the inner surface of your upper eyelid (conjunctiva). Inflammation — intense. In this stage, your eye is now highly infectious and becomes irritated, with a thickening or swelling of the upper eyelid. Eyelid scarring. Repeated infections lead to scarring of the inner eyelid. The scars often appear as white lines when examined with magnification. Your eyelid may become distorted and may turn in (entropion). In-turned eyelashes (trichiasis). The scarred inner lining of your eyelid continues to deform, causing your lashes to turn in so that they rub on and scratch the transparent outer surface of your eye (cornea). Corneal clouding (opacity). The cornea becomes affected by an inflammation that is most commonly seen under your upper lid. Continuous inflammation compounded by scratching from the in-turned lashes leads to clouding of the cornea.  All the signs of trachoma are more severe in your upper lid than in your lower lid.

"Signs and symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system can develop relatively quickly, often over days to weeks. Signs and symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system often begin even before a cancer is diagnosed. Signs and symptoms vary depending on the body part being injured, and may include:  Difficulty walking Difficulty maintaining balance Loss of muscle coordination Loss of muscle tone or weakness Loss of fine motor skills, such as picking up objects Difficulty swallowing Slurred speech or stuttering Memory loss and other thinking (cognitive) impairment Vision problems Sleep disturbances Seizures Hallucinations Unusual involuntary movements  Types of paraneoplastic syndromes Examples of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system include:  Cerebellar degeneration (cerebellar ataxia). This is the loss of nerve cells in the area of the brain that controls muscle functions and balance (cerebellum). Signs and symptoms may include unsteady or impaired walking, lack of muscle coordination in your limbs, inability to maintain your trunk posture, dizziness, nausea, involuntary eye movement, double vision, difficulty speaking, or difficulty swallowing. Limbic encephalitis. This is inflammation affecting a region of the brain known as the limbic system, which controls emotions, behaviors and certain memory functions. People with this disorder may experience personality changes or mood disturbances, memory loss, seizures, hallucinations, or drowsiness. Encephalomyelitis. This syndrome refers to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. There may be a wide variety of symptoms and signs depending on the area affected. Opsoclonus-myoclonus. This syndrome is due to dysfunction of the cerebellum or its connections. It can cause rapid, irregular eye movements (opsoclonus) and involuntary, chaotic muscle jerks (myoclonus) in your limbs and trunk. Stiff person syndrome. Previously called stiff man syndrome, this syndrome is characterized by progressive, severe muscle stiffness or rigidity, mainly affecting your spine and legs. It may also cause painful muscle spasms. Myelopathy. This term refers to a syndrome of injury limited to the spinal cord. Depending on the level of spinal cord injury, you may have changes in bowel and bladder function, and severe weakness and numbness up to a certain level in your body. If the level of injury includes your neck, you can have severe disability affecting all four limbs.  Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. This is a syndrome caused by disrupted communication between nerves and muscles. Signs and symptoms include pelvic and lower extremity muscle weakness, fatigue, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, irregular eye movement, and double vision. Autonomic nervous system problems can include dry mouth and erectile dysfunction in males. When it occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is typically associated with lung cancer.   Myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is also related to disrupted communication between nerves and muscles and also characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of any of the muscles that are under voluntary control, including muscles in your face, eyes, arms and legs. The muscles involved in chewing, swallowing, talking and breathing may be affected as well. When myasthenia gravis occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, it is typically associated with cancer of the thymus gland (thymoma).  Neuromyotonia. Neuromyotonia — also known as Isaacs' syndrome — is characterized by abnormal impulses in nerve cells outside the brain and spinal cord (peripheral nerve hyperexcitability) that control muscle movement. These impulses can cause twitching, muscle rippling that looks like a ""bag of worms,"" progressive stiffness, muscle cramps, slowed movement and other muscle impairments. Peripheral neuropathy. This condition refers to patterns of damage to nerves that transmit messages from the brain or spinal column to the rest of your body. When damage involves only the sensory nerves of the peripheral nervous system, you can have pain and disturbances in sensation anywhere in your body. Dysautonomia. Dysautonomia refers to a wide range of signs and symptoms resulting from injury to the nerves that regulate involuntary body functions (autonomic nervous system), such as heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and bowel and bladder functions. When this part of the nervous system is affected, common symptoms are low blood pressure, irregular heartbeats and trouble breathing.

However, tinnitus can also cause other types of phantom noises in your ears, including:  Buzzing Roaring Clicking Hissing Humming  Most people who have tinnitus have subjective tinnitus, or tinnitus that only you can hear. The noises of tinnitus may vary in pitch from a low roar to a high squeal, and you may hear it in one or both ears. In some cases, the sound can be so loud it interferes with your ability to concentrate or hear external sound. Tinnitus may be present all the time, or it may come and go. In rare cases, tinnitus can occur as a rhythmic pulsing or whooshing sound, often in time with your heartbeat. This is called pulsatile tinnitus. If you have pulsatile tinnitus, your doctor may be able to hear your tinnitus when he or she does an examination (objective tinnitus).",990.0,"['tinnitus ringing ears', ' external sound present', ' however', ' tinnitus can cause types phantom noises ears', ' including:  buzzing roaring clicking hissing humming  people who tinnitus subjective tinnitus', ' tinnitus only can hear', ' noises tinnitus may vary pitch low roar high squeal', ' may hear ears', ' cases', ' sound can loud interferes ability concentrate hear external sound', ' tinnitus may present time', ' may come go', ' rare cases', ' tinnitus can occur rhythmic pulsing whooshing sound', ' time heartbeat', ' called pulsatile tinnitus', ' pulsatile tinnitus', ' doctor may able hear tinnitus examination (objective tinnitus)', '']",['tinnitus']

"Symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and how severe they are can vary. People with the disorder can:  Have an unreasonably high sense of self-importance and require constant, excessive admiration. Feel that they deserve privileges and special treatment. Expect to be recognized as superior even without achievements. Make achievements and talents seem bigger than they are. Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate. Believe they are superior to others and can only spend time with or be understood by equally special people. Be critical of and look down on people they feel are not important. Expect special favors and expect other people to do what they want without questioning them. Take advantage of others to get what they want. Have an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others. Be envious of others and believe others envy them. Behave in an arrogant way, brag a lot and come across as conceited. Insist on having the best of everything — for instance, the best car or office.  At the same time, people with narcissistic personality disorder have trouble handling anything they view as criticism. They can:  Become impatient or angry when they don't receive special recognition or treatment. Have major problems interacting with others and easily feel slighted. React with rage or contempt and try to belittle other people to make themselves appear superior. Have difficulty managing their emotions and behavior. Experience major problems dealing with stress and adapting to change. Withdraw from or avoid situations in which they might fail. Feel depressed and moody because they fall short of perfection.

"Babies with Rett syndrome usually are born after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Most infants with Rett syndrome seem to grow and behave as expected for the first six months. After that, signs and symptoms start to appear. The most pronounced changes generally occur at 12 to 18 months of age, over a period of weeks or months. Symptoms and their severity vary greatly from child to child. The main signs and symptoms include:  Slowed growth. Brain growth slows after birth. Smaller than usual head size (microcephaly) is sometimes the first sign that a child has Rett syndrome. As children get older, there is delayed growth in other parts of the body. Loss of movement and coordination abilities. The first signs often include reduced hand control and a decreasing ability to crawl or walk. At first, this loss of abilities occurs rapidly, and then it continues more gradually. Eventually muscles become weak or stiff, with unusual movement and positioning. Loss of communication abilities. Children with Rett syndrome typically begin to lose the ability to speak, to make eye contact and to communicate in other ways. They may become disinterested in other people, toys and their surroundings. Some children have rapid changes, such as a sudden loss of language. Over time, children may gradually regain eye contact and develop nonverbal communication skills. Unusual hand movements. Children with Rett syndrome usually develop repetitive, purposeless hand movements, which differ from child to child. Hand movements may include hand-wringing, squeezing, clapping, tapping or rubbing.  Other signs and symptoms can include:  Unusual eye movements. Children with Rett syndrome tend to have unusual eye movements, such as intense staring, blinking, crossed eyes or closing one eye at a time. Breathing problems. These include breath holding, rapid breathing (hyperventilation), forcefully blowing out air or saliva, and swallowing air. These problems tend to occur during waking hours. Other breathing disturbances such as shallow breathing or short periods of stopping breathing (apnea) can occur during sleep. Irritability and crying. Children with Rett syndrome may become increasingly agitated and irritable as they get older. Periods of crying or screaming may begin suddenly, for no apparent reason, and last for hours. Some children may experience fears and anxiety. Other unusual behaviors. These may include, for example, sudden, odd facial expressions and long bouts of laughter, hand licking, and grasping of hair or clothing. Intellectual disabilities. Loss of skills may be connected to losing the ability to think, understand and learn. Seizures. Most people who have Rett syndrome experience seizures at some time during their lives. Multiple seizure types may occur and are associated with changes on an electroencephalogram (EEG). Sideways curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Scoliosis is common with Rett syndrome. It typically begins between 8 and 11 years of age and progresses with age. Surgery may be required if the curvature is severe. Irregular heartbeat. This is a life-threatening problem for many children and adults with Rett syndrome and can result in sudden death. Sleep disturbances. Problems with sleep patterns can include irregular sleep times, falling asleep during the day and being awake at night, or waking in the night with crying or screaming. Other symptoms. A variety of other symptoms can occur, such as a decreased response to pain; small hands and feet that are usually cold; problems with chewing and swallowing; problems with bowel function; and teeth grinding.  Stages of Rett syndrome Rett syndrome is commonly divided into four stages:  Stage 1: Early onset. Signs and symptoms are subtle and easily overlooked during the first stage, which starts between 6 and 18 months of age. Stage 1 can last for a few months or a year. Babies in this stage may show less eye contact and start to lose interest in toys. They may also have delays in sitting or crawling. Stage 2: Rapid deterioration. Starting between 1 and 4 years of age, children lose the ability to perform skills they previously had. This loss can be rapid or more gradual, occurring over weeks or months. Symptoms of Rett syndrome occur, such as slowed head growth, abnormal hand movements, hyperventilating, screaming or crying for no apparent reason, problems with movement and coordination, and a loss of social interaction and communication. Stage 3: Plateau. The third stage usually begins between the ages of 2 and 10 years, and it can last for many years. Although problems with movement continue, behavior may slightly improve, with less crying and irritability, and there may be some improvement in hand use and communication. Seizures may begin in this stage and generally don't occur before the age of 2. Stage 4: Late motor deterioration. This stage usually begins after the age of 10 and can last for years or decades.

Blood-clotting factors are substances in your blood that help stop bleeding. These abnormalities can lead to small blood clots forming more often than they normally would. In addition, people with calciphylaxis have an imbalance in the metabolism of calcium. This causes calcium to be deposited in the smallest parts of the arteries (arterioles), which eventually leads to the formation of blood clots in the arterioles.

"Signs and symptoms of CAH vary, depending on which gene is affected and the level of enzyme deficiency. The imbalance of hormones the body needs to function may mean too little cortisol, too little aldosterone, excess androgens or a combination of these imbalances. CAH Classic CAH Signs and symptoms of classic CAH may include: CAH  Insufficient cortisol. Classic CAH causes the body to produce an insufficient amount of cortisol. This can cause problems maintaining normal blood pressure, blood sugar and energy levels, and cause problems during physical stress such as illness. Adrenal crisis. People with classic CAH can be seriously affected by a lack of cortisol, aldosterone or both. This is known as an adrenal crisis, and it can be life-threatening.  Atypical genitalia. Female infants may have atypical genitalia appearance, such as an enlarged clitoris that may resemble a penis, and a partially closed labia resembling a scrotum. The urinary opening (urethra) and the vagina may be only one opening instead of two separate openings. The uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries usually develop typically. Male infants usually have typical-appearing genitals.   Excess androgen. An excess of the male sex hormone androgen can result in short height and early puberty for both males and females. Pubic hair and other signs of puberty may appear at a very early age. Severe acne also may occur. Excess androgen hormones in females may result in facial hair, excessive body hair and a deepening voice.  Altered growth. Rapid growth may occur during childhood with an advanced bone age. Final height may be shorter than average. Fertility issues. These can include irregular menstrual periods, or not having any at all, and having infertility problems in females. Fertility issues can sometimes occur in males.  Nonclassic CAH Often there are no symptoms of nonclassic CAH when a baby is born. Some people with nonclassic CAH never have symptoms. The condition is not identified on routine infant blood screening and usually becomes evident in late childhood or early adulthood. Cortisol may be the only hormone that's deficient.

CAS Some symptoms may be unique to children with CAS and can be helpful to diagnose the problem. However, some symptoms of CAS are also symptoms of other types of speech or language disorders. It's difficult to diagnose CAS if a child has only symptoms that are found both in CAS and in other types of speech or language disorders. CAS CAS CAS CAS Some characteristics, sometimes called markers, help distinguish CAS from other types of speech disorders. Those particularly associated with CAS include: CAS CAS  Difficulty moving smoothly from one sound, syllable or word to another Groping movements with the jaw, lips or tongue to make the correct movement for speech sounds Vowel distortions, such as attempting to use the correct vowel, but saying it incorrectly Using the wrong stress in a word, such as pronouncing ""banana"" as ""BUH-nan-uh"" instead of ""buh-NAN-uh"" Using equal emphasis on all syllables, such as saying ""BUH-NAN-UH"" Separation of syllables, such as putting a pause or gap between syllables Inconsistency, such as making different errors when trying to say the same word a second time Difficulty imitating simple words Inconsistent voicing errors, such as saying ""down"" instead of ""town""  Other characteristics are seen in most children with speech or language problems and aren't helpful in distinguishing CAS. Characteristics seen both in children with CAS and in children with other types of speech or language disorders include: CAS CAS  Babbling less or making fewer vocal sounds than is typical between the ages of 7 to 12 months old Speaking first words late (after ages 12 to 18 months old) Using a limited number of consonants and vowels Frequently leaving out (omitting) sounds Using speech that is difficult to understand speech  Other speech disorders sometimes confused with CAS Some speech sound disorders often get confused with CAS because some of the characteristics may overlap. These speech sound disorders include articulation disorders, phonological disorders and dysarthria. CAS A child who has trouble learning how to make specific sounds, but doesn't have trouble planning or coordinating the movements to speak, may have an articulation or phonological disorder. Articulation and phonological disorders are more common than CAS. CAS Articulation or phonological speech errors may include:  Substituting sounds, such as saying ""fum"" instead of ""thumb,"" ""wabbit"" instead of ""rabbit"" or ""tup"" instead of ""cup"" Leaving out (omitting) final consonants, such as saying ""duh"" instead of ""duck"" or ""uh"" instead of ""up"" Stopping the airstream, such as saying ""tun"" instead of ""sun"" or ""doo"" instead of ""zoo"" Simplifying sound combinations, such as saying ""ting"" instead of ""string"" or ""fog"" instead of ""frog""  Dysarthria is a motor speech disorder that is due to weakness, spasticity or inability to control the speech muscles. Making speech sounds is difficult because the speech muscles can't move as far, as quickly or as strongly as normal. People with dysarthria may also have a hoarse, soft or even strained voice, or slurred or slow speech. Dysarthria is often easier to identify than CAS. However, when dysarthria is caused by damage to certain areas of the brain that affect coordination, it can be difficult to determine the differences between CAS and dysarthria.",197.0,"['children childhood apraxia speech (cas) may speech symptoms characteristics vary depending age severity speech problems', ' cas can associated with: cas  delayed onset first words limited number spoken words ability form only consonant vowel sounds  symptoms noticed ages 18 months 2 years', ' may suspected cas', ' cas children produce speech', ' ages 2 4', ' characteristics likely cas include: cas  vowel consonant distortions separation syllables words voicing errors', ' ""pie"" sounding like ""bye""  children cas difficulty jaws', ' lips tongues correct positions sound', ' may difficulty moving smoothly next sound', ' cas children cas language problems', ' reduced vocabulary difficulty word order', ' cas symptoms may unique children cas can helpful diagnose problem', ' however', ' symptoms cas symptoms types speech language disorders', "" it's difficult diagnose cas child only symptoms found cas types speech language disorders"", ' cas cas cas cas characteristics', ' called markers', ' help distinguish cas types speech disorders', ' associated cas include: cas cas  difficulty moving smoothly sound', ' syllable word groping movements jaw', ' lips tongue correct movement speech sounds vowel distortions', ' attempting correct vowel', ' saying incorrectly using wrong stress word', ' pronouncing ""banana"" ""buh-nan-uh"" ""buh-nan-uh"" using equal emphasis syllables', ' saying ""buh-nan-uh"" separation syllables', ' putting pause gap syllables inconsistency', ' making errors trying say word second time difficulty imitating simple words inconsistent voicing errors', ' saying ""down"" ""town""  characteristics seen children speech language problems aren\'t helpful distinguishing cas', ' characteristics seen children cas children types speech language disorders include: cas cas  babbling making vocal sounds typical ages 7 12 months old speaking first words late (after ages 12 18 months old) using limited number consonants vowels frequently leaving (omitting) sounds using speech difficult understand speech  speech disorders confused cas speech sound disorders confused cas characteristics may overlap', ' speech sound disorders include articulation disorders', ' phonological disorders dysarthria', ' cas child who trouble learning specific sounds', "" doesn't trouble planning coordinating movements speak"", ' may articulation phonological disorder', ' articulation phonological disorders common cas', ' cas articulation phonological speech errors may include:  substituting sounds', ' saying ""fum"" ""thumb', '"" ""wabbit"" ""rabbit"" ""tup"" ""cup"" leaving (omitting) final consonants', ' saying ""duh"" ""duck"" ""uh"" ""up"" stopping airstream', ' saying ""tun"" ""sun"" ""doo"" ""zoo"" simplifying sound combinations', ' saying ""ting"" ""string"" ""fog"" ""frog""  dysarthria motor speech disorder due weakness', ' spasticity inability control speech muscles', "" making speech sounds difficult speech muscles can't move far"", ' quickly strongly normal', ' people dysarthria may hoarse', ' soft strained voice', ' slurred slow speech', ' dysarthria easier identify cas', ' however', ' dysarthria caused damage areas brain affect coordination', ' can difficult determine differences cas dysarthria', '']",['childhood apraxia of speech']

Most people infected with the virus that causes polio, called poliovirus, don't get symptoms. Abortive polio About 5% of people with the poliovirus get a mild version of the disease called abortive poliomyelitis. This leads to flu-like symptoms that last 2 to 3 days. These include:  Fever Headache Muscle aches Sore throat Stomachache Loss of appetite Nausea Vomiting  Nonparalytic polio A more severe form of the disease, called nonparalytic polio, affects about 1% of those infected. While the illness lasts longer than a few days, it doesn't cause paralysis. Besides having more-severe flu-like symptoms, nonparalytic polio symptoms may include:  Neck pain or stiffness Aches or stiffness in the arms or legs Severe headache  A second phase of symptoms may follow, or a person may seem to be getting better for a few days before a second phase starts. These symptoms include:  Stiffness of the spine and neck Decreased reflexes Muscle weakness  Paralytic polio This most serious form of the disease is rare. The disease begins much like nonparalytic polio. But it progresses to more-severe signs and symptoms, including:  Intense pain Extreme sensitivity to touch Tingling or pricking sensations Muscles spasms or twitching Muscles weakness progressing to a limp paralysis  Any combination of limbs may experience paralysis. But paralysis of one leg is most common, followed by paralysis of one arm. Depending on the severity of disease, other signs or symptoms may include:  Paralysis of muscles involved in breathing Difficulty swallowing  Post-polio syndrome Post-polio syndrome is the appearance of new signs or symptoms or the progression of problems. This usually happens decades after having polio. Common signs and symptoms include:  Progressive muscle or joint weakness and pain Fatigue Muscle wasting Breathing or swallowing problems Sleep-related breathing disorders, such as sleep apnea Lowered tolerance of cold temperatures ",770.0,"['           nerve cell (neuron)       open pop-up dialog box          close    nerve cell (neuron)   nerve cell (neuron) basic unit communication nervous system nerve cell (neuron)', ' nerve cell consists cell body', ' includes nucleus', ' major branching fiber (axon) numerous smaller branching fibers (dendrites)', ' myelin sheath fatty material covers', ' insulates protects nerves brain spinal cord', '               nerve cell (neuron)       open pop-up dialog box           nerve cell (neuron)       open pop-up dialog box  open pop-up dialog box       close    nerve cell (neuron)   nerve cell (neuron) basic unit communication nervous system nerve cell (neuron)', ' nerve cell consists cell body', ' includes nucleus', ' major branching fiber (axon) numerous smaller branching fibers (dendrites)', ' myelin sheath fatty material covers', ' insulates protects nerves brain spinal cord', '          close    nerve cell (neuron)   nerve cell (neuron) basic unit communication nervous system nerve cell (neuron)', ' nerve cell consists cell body', ' includes nucleus', ' major branching fiber (axon) numerous smaller branching fibers (dendrites)', ' myelin sheath fatty material covers', ' insulates protects nerves brain spinal cord', '        close    nerve cell (neuron)   nerve cell (neuron) basic unit communication nervous system nerve cell (neuron)', ' nerve cell consists cell body', ' includes nucleus', ' major branching fiber (axon) numerous smaller branching fibers (dendrites)', ' myelin sheath fatty material covers', ' insulates protects nerves brain spinal cord', '     close    close  close nerve cell (neuron)   nerve cell (neuron) basic unit communication nervous system nerve cell (neuron)', ' nerve cell consists cell body', ' includes nucleus', ' major branching fiber (axon) numerous smaller branching fibers (dendrites)', ' myelin sheath fatty material covers', ' insulates protects nerves brain spinal cord', '  nerve cell (neuron) basic unit communication nervous system nerve cell (neuron)', ' nerve cell consists cell body', ' includes nucleus', ' major branching fiber (axon) numerous smaller branching fibers (dendrites)', ' myelin sheath fatty material covers', ' insulates protects nerves brain spinal cord', ' basic unit communication nervous system nerve cell (neuron)', ' nerve cell consists cell body', ' includes nucleus', ' major branching fiber (axon) numerous smaller branching fibers (dendrites)', ' myelin sheath fatty material covers', ' insulates protects nerves brain spinal cord', ' people infected virus causes polio', ' called poliovirus', "" don't symptoms"", ' abortive polio 5% people poliovirus mild version disease called abortive poliomyelitis', ' leads flu-like symptoms last 2 3 days', ' include:  fever headache muscle aches sore throat stomachache loss appetite nausea vomiting  nonparalytic polio severe form disease', ' called nonparalytic polio', ' affects 1% infected', ' illness lasts longer days', "" doesn't cause paralysis"", ' more-severe flu-like symptoms', ' nonparalytic polio symptoms may include:  neck pain stiffness aches stiffness arms legs severe headache  second phase symptoms may follow', ' person may days second phase starts', ' symptoms include:  stiffness spine neck decreased reflexes muscle weakness  paralytic polio form disease rare', ' disease begins like nonparalytic polio', ' progresses more-severe signs symptoms', ' including:  intense pain extreme sensitivity touch tingling pricking sensations muscles spasms twitching muscles weakness progressing limp paralysis  combination limbs may experience paralysis', ' paralysis leg common', ' followed paralysis arm', ' depending severity disease', ' signs symptoms may include:  paralysis muscles involved breathing difficulty swallowing  post-polio syndrome post-polio syndrome appearance new signs symptoms progression problems', ' happens decades polio', ' common signs symptoms include:  progressive muscle joint weakness pain fatigue muscle wasting breathing swallowing problems sleep-related breathing disorders', ' sleep apnea lowered tolerance cold temperatures ']",['polio']

You might not realize you have bone spurs until an X-ray for another condition reveals the growths. In some cases, though, bone spurs can cause pain and loss of motion in your joints. Specific symptoms depend on where the bone spurs are. Examples include:  Knee. Bone spurs in your knee can make it painful to extend and bend your leg. Spine. On your vertebrae, bone spurs can narrow the space that contains your spinal cord. These bone spurs can pinch the spinal cord or its nerve roots and can cause weakness or numbness in your arms or legs. Hip. Bone spurs can make it painful to move your hip, although you might feel the pain in your knee. Depending on their placement, bone spurs can reduce the range of motion in your hip joint.

"Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking, behavior or emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. The effect can be disabling. In most people with schizophrenia, symptoms generally start in the mid- to late 20s, though it can start later, up to the mid-30s. Schizophrenia is considered early onset when it starts before the age of 18. Onset of schizophrenia in children younger than age 13 is extremely rare. Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. Schizophrenia can be difficult to recognize in the early phases. Early signs and symptoms Schizophrenia signs and symptoms in children and teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize in this age group. Early signs and symptoms may include problems with thinking, behavior and emotions. Thinking:  Problems with thinking and reasoning Bizarre ideas or speech Confusing dreams or television for reality  Behavior:  Withdrawal from friends and family Trouble sleeping Lack of motivation — for example, showing up as a drop in performance at school Not meeting daily expectations, such as bathing or dressing Bizarre behavior Violent or aggressive behavior or agitation Recreational drug or nicotine use  Emotions:  Irritability or depressed mood Lack of emotion, or emotions inappropriate for the situation Strange anxieties and fears Excessive suspicion of others  Later signs and symptoms As children with schizophrenia age, more typical signs and symptoms of the disorder begin to appear. Signs and symptoms may include:  Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; that certain gestures or comments are directed at you; that you have exceptional ability or fame; that another person is in love with you; or that a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia. Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, hallucinations have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination. Disorganized thinking. Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad. Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior is not focused on a goal, which makes it hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement. Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion — doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions, speaks in a monotone, or doesn't add hand or head movements that normally occur when speaking. Also, the person may avoid people and activities or lack the ability to experience pleasure.  Compared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, children and teens may be:  Less likely to have delusions More likely to have visual hallucinations  Symptoms may be difficult to interpret When childhood schizophrenia begins early in life, symptoms may build up gradually. Early signs and symptoms may be so vague that you can't recognize what's wrong. Some early signs can be mistaken for typical development during early teen years, or they could be symptoms of other mental or physical conditions.  As time goes on, signs may become more severe and more noticeable. Eventually, your child may develop the symptoms of psychosis, including hallucinations, delusions and difficulty organizing thoughts.

"The four main characteristics of Henoch-Schonlein purpura include:  Rash (purpura). Reddish-purple spots that look like bruises develop on the buttocks, legs and feet. The rash can also appear on the arms, face and trunk and may be worse in areas of pressure, such as the sock line and waistline. Swollen, sore joints (arthritis). People with Henoch-Schonlein purpura often have pain and swelling around the joints — mainly in the knees and ankles. Joint pain sometimes precedes the classical rash by one or two weeks. These symptoms subside when the disease clears and leave no lasting damage. Digestive tract symptoms. Many children with Henoch-Schonlein purpura develop belly pain, nausea, vomiting and bloody stools. These symptoms sometimes occur before the rash appears. Kidney involvement. Henoch-Schonlein purpura can also affect the kidneys. In most cases, this shows up as protein or blood in the urine, which you may not even know is there unless you have a urine test done.

"Scleroderma's signs and symptoms vary from person to person, depending on which parts of the body are affected. Skin-related signs and symptoms Nearly everyone who has scleroderma experiences a hardening and tightening of the skin. The first parts of the body to be affected are usually the fingers, hands, feet and face. In some people, the skin thickening can also involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness. Some people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays. Raynaud's phenomenon Raynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma. Digestive problems Scleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, signs and symptoms may include:  Heartburn Difficulty swallowing Bloating Diarrhea Constipation Fecal incontinence  Heart and lung problems When scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage. Scleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart. When scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular.

"The main sign of muscular dystrophy is progressive muscle weakness. Specific signs and symptoms begin at different ages and in different muscle groups, depending on the type of muscular dystrophy. Duchenne type muscular dystrophy This is the most common form. Although girls can be carriers and mildly affected, it's much more common in boys. Signs and symptoms, which typically appear in early childhood, might include:  Frequent falls Difficulty rising from a lying or sitting position Trouble running and jumping Waddling gait Walking on the toes Large calf muscles Muscle pain and stiffness Learning disabilities Delayed growth  Becker muscular dystrophy Signs and symptoms are similar to those of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, but tend to be milder and progress more slowly. Symptoms generally begin in the teens but might not occur until the mid-20s or later. Other types of muscular dystrophy Some types of muscular dystrophy are defined by a specific feature or by where in the body symptoms begin. Examples include:  Myotonic. This is characterized by an inability to relax muscles following contractions. Facial and neck muscles are usually the first to be affected. People with this form typically have long, thin faces; drooping eyelids; and swanlike necks. Facioscapulohumeral (FSHD). Muscle weakness typically begins in the face, hip and shoulders. The shoulder blades might stick out like wings when arms are raised. Onset usually occurs in the teenage years but can begin in childhood or as late as age 50. Congenital.

"Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision. Skin The easiest form of albinism to see results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings or other blood relatives. But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown. People of African descent who have albinism may have skin that is light brown or red brown and have freckles. For some people, skin color may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism. With exposure to the sun, some people may develop:  Freckles. Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink. Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez). Sunburn and no ability to tan.  For some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in color. Hair Hair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, red or brown. Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. Or hair may stain from contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age. Eye color Eyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age. With albinism, the colored parts of the eyes, called the irises, usually don't have enough pigment. This allows light to shine through the irises and makes the eyes extremely sensitive to bright light. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting. Vision Vision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems may include:  Rapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can't be controlled, called nystagmus. An uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better. Eyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus. Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness. Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia. A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision. Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision. Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve. Poor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is. Legal blindness — vision less than 20/200 — or complete blindness.

"Most people infected with toxoplasmosis do not have any symptoms. They often don't know they're infected. Some people have flu-like symptoms, including:  Fever. Swollen lymph nodes that may last for weeks. Headache. Muscle aches. Skin rash.  Symptoms of eye disease The toxoplasma parasites may infect tissues of the inner eye. This can occur in people with healthy immune systems. But the disease is more serious in people with weakened immunity. An infection in the eye is called ocular toxoplasmosis. Symptoms may include:  Eye pain. Poor vision. Floaters, which are specks that seem to swim in your vision.  Untreated eye disease can cause blindness. Effect on people with weakened immune systems People with weakened immune systems are likely to have more-serious disease from toxoplasmosis. A toxoplasmosis infection from earlier in life may become active again. People at risk include those living with HIV/AIDS, people receiving cancer treatment and people with a transplanted organ. In addition to serious eye disease, toxoplasmosis can cause severe lung or brain disease for a person with weakened immunity. Rarely, the infection can show up in other tissues throughout the body. Lung infection may cause:  Breathing problems. Fever. Cough.  Toxoplasmosis may cause inflammation of the brain, also called encephalitis. Symptoms may include:  Confusion. Poor coordination. Muscle weakness. Seizures. Changes in alertness.  Effect on fetus or infant Toxoplasmosis can pass from the mother to the fetus during a pregnancy. This is called congenital toxoplasmosis. Infection during the first trimester often causes more-severe disease. It also may result in miscarriage. For some babies with toxoplasmosis, serious disease may be present at birth or appear early in infancy. Medical problems may include:  Too much fluid in or around the brain, also called hydrocephalus. Severe eye infection. Irregularities in brain tissues. An enlarged liver or spleen.  Symptoms of severe disease vary. They may include:  Problems with mental or motor skills. Blindness or other vision problems. Hearing problems. Seizures. Heart disorders. Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, also called jaundice. Rash.  Most babies with toxoplasmosis do not show symptoms. But problems may show up later in childhood or teenage years. These include:  Return of eye infections. Problems with motor skill development. Problems with thinking and learning. Hearing loss. Slowed growth. Early puberty.

Signs and symptoms can include:  Exaggerated startle response when the baby hears loud noises ""Cherry-red"" spots in the eyes Loss of motor skills, including turning over, crawling and sitting up Muscle weakness, progressing to paralysis Movement problems Seizures Vision loss and blindness Hearing loss and deafness Problems swallowing Loss of mental functions and a lack of response to surroundings Growth in head size (progressive macrocephaly)  Juvenile form The juvenile form of Tay-Sachs disease is less common. Signs and symptoms vary in severity and begin in childhood. Survival is typically into the teen years. Signs and symptoms can include:  Behavior problems Gradual loss of skills and movement control Frequent respiratory infections Slow loss of vision and speech Decline in mental function and responsiveness Seizures  Last onset/adult form This is a rare and less severe form with signs and symptoms beginning in late childhood to adulthood.

"Signs and symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome can vary among individuals. Symptoms may slowly change over time from childhood to adulthood. Infants Signs and symptoms that may be present from birth include:  Poor muscle tone. A primary sign during infancy is poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Babies may rest with their elbows and knees loosely extended instead of fixed, and they may feel floppy or like rag dolls when they're held. Distinct facial features. Children may be born with almond-shaped eyes, a narrowing of the head at the temples, a turned-down mouth and a thin upper lip. Poor sucking reflex. Infants may have a poor sucking reflex due to decreased muscle tone. Poor sucking makes feeding difficult and can result in failure to thrive. Generally poor responsiveness. A baby may seem unusually tired, respond poorly to stimulation, have a hard time waking up or have a weak cry. Underdeveloped genitals. Males may have a small penis and scrotum. The testicles may be small or not descended from the abdomen into the scrotum (cryptorchidism). In females, the clitoris and labia may be small.  Early childhood to adulthood Other features of Prader-Willi syndrome appear during early childhood and remain throughout life, requiring careful management. These features may include:  Food craving and weight gain. A classic sign of Prader-Willi syndrome is a constant craving for food, resulting in rapid weight gain, starting around age 2 years. Constant hunger leads to eating often and consuming large portions. Unusual food-seeking behaviors, such as hoarding food, or eating frozen food or even garbage, may develop. Underdeveloped sex organs. A condition called hypogonadism occurs when sex organs (testes in men and ovaries in women) produce little or no sex hormones. This results in underdeveloped sex organs, incomplete or delayed puberty, and in nearly all cases, infertility. Without treatment, women may not start menstruating until their 30s or may never menstruate, and men may not have much facial hair and their voices may never fully deepen. Poor growth and physical development. Underproduction of growth hormone can result in short adult height, low muscle mass and high body fat. Other endocrine problems may include underproduction of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or central adrenal insufficiency, which prevents the body from responding appropriately during stress or infections. Cognitive impairment. Mild to moderate intellectual disability, such as issues with thinking, reasoning and problem-solving, is a common feature of the disorder. Even those without significant intellectual disability have some learning disabilities. Delayed motor development. Toddlers with Prader-Willi syndrome often reach milestones in physical movement — for example, sitting up or walking — later than other children do. Speech problems. Speech is often delayed. Poor articulation of words may be an ongoing problem into adulthood. Behavioral problems. Children and adults may at times be stubborn, angry, controlling or manipulative. They may throw temper tantrums, especially when denied food, and may not tolerate changes in routine. They may also develop obsessive-compulsive or repetitive behaviors, or both. Other mental health disorders, such as anxiety and skin picking, may develop. Sleep disorders. Children and adults with Prader-Willi syndrome may have sleep disorders, including disruptions of the normal sleep cycle and a condition in which breathing pauses during sleep (sleep apnea). These disorders can result in excessive daytime sleepiness and worsen behavior problems. Other signs and symptoms. These may include small hands and feet, curvature of the spine (scoliosis), hip problems, reduced saliva flow, nearsightedness and other vision problems, problems regulating body temperature, a high pain tolerance, or a lack of pigment (hypopigmentation) causing hair, eyes and skin to be pale.

"Schizotypal personality disorder typically includes five or more of these signs and symptoms:  Being a loner and lacking close friends outside of the immediate family Flat emotions or limited or inappropriate emotional responses Persistent and excessive social anxiety Incorrect interpretation of events, such as a feeling that something that is actually harmless or inoffensive has a direct personal meaning Peculiar, eccentric or unusual thinking, beliefs or mannerisms Suspicious or paranoid thoughts and constant doubts about the loyalty of others Belief in special powers, such as mental telepathy or superstitions Unusual perceptions, such as sensing an absent person's presence or having illusions Dressing in peculiar ways, such as appearing unkempt or wearing oddly matched clothes Peculiar style of speech, such as vague or unusual patterns of speaking, or rambling oddly during conversations  Signs and symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder, such as increased interest in solitary activities or a high level of social anxiety, may be seen in the teen years. The child may be an underperformer in school or appear socially out of step with peers, which may result in teasing or bullying. Schizotypal personality disorder vs. schizophrenia Schizotypal personality disorder can easily be confused with schizophrenia, a severe mental illness in which people lose contact with reality (psychosis). While people with schizotypal personality disorder may experience brief psychotic episodes with delusions or hallucinations, the episodes are not as frequent, prolonged or intense as in schizophrenia. Another key distinction is that people with schizotypal personality disorder usually can be made aware of the difference between their distorted ideas and reality. Those with schizophrenia generally can't be swayed away from their delusions. Despite the differences, people with schizotypal personality disorder can benefit from treatments similar to those used for schizophrenia. Schizotypal personality disorder is sometimes considered to be on a spectrum with schizophrenia, with schizotypal personality disorder viewed as less severe.",883.0,"['schizotypal personality disorder typically includes signs symptoms:  being loner lacking close friends family flat emotions limited inappropriate emotional responses persistent excessive social anxiety incorrect interpretation events', ' feeling actually harmless inoffensive direct personal meaning peculiar', ' eccentric unusual thinking', ' beliefs mannerisms suspicious paranoid thoughts constant doubts loyalty belief special powers', ' mental telepathy superstitions unusual perceptions', "" sensing absent person's presence illusions dressing peculiar ways"", ' unkempt wearing oddly matched clothes peculiar style speech', ' vague unusual patterns speaking', ' rambling oddly conversations  signs symptoms schizotypal personality disorder', ' increased interest solitary activities high level social anxiety', ' may seen teen years', ' child may underperformer school socially step peers', ' may result teasing bullying', ' schizotypal personality disorder vs', ' schizophrenia schizotypal personality disorder can easily confused schizophrenia', ' severe mental illness people lose contact reality (psychosis)', ' people schizotypal personality disorder may experience brief psychotic episodes delusions hallucinations', ' episodes frequent', ' prolonged intense schizophrenia', ' key distinction people schizotypal personality disorder can made aware difference distorted ideas reality', "" schizophrenia generally can't swayed away delusions"", ' differences', ' people schizotypal personality disorder can benefit treatments similar schizophrenia', ' schizotypal personality disorder considered spectrum schizophrenia', ' schizotypal personality disorder viewed severe', '']",['schizotypal personality disorder']

Both migraine and sinusitis headache pain often get worse when you bend forward. Migraine can also be accompanied by various nasal signs and symptoms — including congestion, facial pressure and a clear, watery nasal discharge. These are due to involvement of the autonomic nervous system in a migraine attack.

"Signs and symptoms of small bowel cancer include:  Abdominal pain Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice) Feeling unusually weak or tired Nausea Vomiting Losing weight without trying Blood in the stool, which might appear red or black Watery diarrhea Skin flushing  Causes Doctors aren't certain what causes most small bowel cancers. In general, small bowel cancer begins when healthy cells in the small bowel develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains a set of instructions that tell a cell what to do. Healthy cells grow and divide in an orderly way to keep your body functioning normally. But when a cell's DNA is damaged and becomes cancerous, cells continue to divide — even when new cells aren't needed. As these cells accumulate, they form a tumor. With time, the cancer cells can grow to invade and destroy normal tissue nearby. And cancerous cells can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of small bowel cancer include:  Gene mutations passed through families. Some gene mutations that are inherited from your parents can increase your risk of small bowel cancer and other cancers. Examples include Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Other bowel diseases. Other diseases and conditions that affect the intestines may increase the risk of small bowel cancer, including Crohn's disease, inflammatory bowel disease and celiac disease. Weakened immune system. If your body's germ-fighting immune system is weakened, you may have an increased risk of small bowel cancer. Examples include people with HIV infection and those who take anti-rejection medicine after an organ transplant.  Complications Small bowel cancer can cause complications, including:  An increased risk of other cancers. People who have small bowel cancer run a higher risk of having other types of cancers, including those that affect the colon, rectum, ovaries and the lining of the uterus (endometrium). Cancer that spreads to other parts of the body. Advanced small bowel cancer can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, most often the liver.  Prevention It's not clear what may help to reduce the risk of small bowel cancer, since it's very uncommon. If you're interested in reducing your risk of cancer in general, it may help to:  Eat a variety of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Fruits, vegetables and whole grains contain vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants, which may help reduce your risk of cancer and other diseases. Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables so that you get an array of vitamins and nutrients. Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount of alcohol you drink to no more than one drink a day for women of all ages and men older than age 65, and up to two drinks a day for men age 65 and younger. Stop smoking. Talk to your doctor about ways to quit that may work for you. Exercise most days of the week. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days. If you've been inactive, start slowly and build up gradually to 30 minutes. Also, talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program. Maintain a healthy weight. If you are at a healthy weight, work to maintain your weight by combining a healthy diet with daily exercise. If you need to lose weight, ask your doctor about healthy ways to achieve your goal. Aim to lose weight slowly by increasing the amount of exercise you get and reducing the number of calories you eat.

"The two main features of amnesia are:  Trouble learning new information. Trouble remembering past events and previously familiar information.  Most people with amnesia have problems with short-term memory, so they can't retain new information. Recent memories are most likely to be lost. More-remote or deeply ingrained memories may be spared. For example, people may recall experiences from childhood or know the names of past presidents. But they may not be able to name the current president, know the month or remember what they ate for breakfast. Isolated memory loss doesn't affect a person's intelligence, general knowledge, awareness or attention span. It also doesn't affect judgment, personality or identity. People with amnesia usually can understand written and spoken words and can learn skills such as bike riding or piano playing. They may understand they have a memory disorder. Amnesia isn't the same as dementia. Dementia often includes memory loss but also involves other problems with thinking that lead to a decline in daily functioning. These problems include having trouble with language, judgment and visual-spatial skills. Memory loss also is a common symptom of mild cognitive impairment. This disorder involves memory and other cognitive problems that aren't as severe as those experienced in dementia.

The disease can be present with the appearance of a single chancre (shown here on a penis) or many. Syphilis develops in stages, and symptoms vary with each stage. But the stages may overlap, and symptoms don't always occur in the same order. You may be infected with syphilis without noticing any symptoms for years. Primary syphilis The first sign of syphilis is a small sore, called a chancre (SHANG-kur). The sore appears at the spot where the bacteria entered your body. While most people infected with syphilis develop only one chancre, some people develop several of them. The chancre usually develops about three weeks after exposure. Many people who have syphilis don't notice the chancre because it's usually painless, and it may be hidden within the vagina or rectum. The chancre will heal on its own within three to six weeks. Secondary syphilis Within a few weeks of the original chancre healing, you may experience a rash that begins on your trunk but eventually covers your entire body — even the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet. This rash is usually not itchy and may be accompanied by wartlike sores in your mouth or genital area. Some people also experience hair loss, muscle aches, a fever, a sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. These signs and symptoms may disappear within a few weeks or repeatedly come and go for as long as a year. Latent syphilis If you aren't treated for syphilis, the disease moves from the secondary stage to the hidden (latent) stage, when you have no symptoms. The latent stage can last for years. Signs and symptoms may never return, or the disease may progress to the third (tertiary) stage. Tertiary syphilis About 15% to 30% of people infected with syphilis who don't get treatment will develop complications known as tertiary syphilis. In the late stage, the disease may damage the brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones and joints. These problems may occur many years after the original, untreated infection. Neurosyphilis At any stage, syphilis can spread and, among other damage, cause damage to the brain and nervous system and the eye. Congenital syphilis Babies born to women who have syphilis can become infected through the placenta or during birth. Most newborns with congenital syphilis have no symptoms, although some experience a rash on the palms of their hands and the soles of their feet. Later signs and symptoms may include deafness, teeth deformities and saddle nose — where the bridge of the nose collapses. However, babies born with syphilis can also be born too early, may die in the womb before birth or can die after birth.",964.0,"['           primary syphilis       open pop-up dialog box          close    primary syphilis   primary syphilis primary syphilis causes painless sores (chancres) genitals', ' rectum', ' tongue lips', ' disease can present appearance single chancre (shown here penis) many', '               primary syphilis       open pop-up dialog box           primary syphilis       open pop-up dialog box  open pop-up dialog box       close    primary syphilis   primary syphilis primary syphilis causes painless sores (chancres) genitals', ' rectum', ' tongue lips', ' disease can present appearance single chancre (shown here penis) many', '          close    primary syphilis   primary syphilis primary syphilis causes painless sores (chancres) genitals', ' rectum', ' tongue lips', ' disease can present appearance single chancre (shown here penis) many', '        close    primary syphilis   primary syphilis primary syphilis causes painless sores (chancres) genitals', ' rectum', ' tongue lips', ' disease can present appearance single chancre (shown here penis) many', '     close    close  close primary syphilis   primary syphilis primary syphilis causes painless sores (chancres) genitals', ' rectum', ' tongue lips', ' disease can present appearance single chancre (shown here penis) many', '  primary syphilis primary syphilis causes painless sores (chancres) genitals', ' rectum', ' tongue lips', ' disease can present appearance single chancre (shown here penis) many', ' primary syphilis causes painless sores (chancres) genitals', ' rectum', ' tongue lips', ' disease can present appearance single chancre (shown here penis) many', ' syphilis develops stages', ' symptoms vary stage', ' stages may overlap', "" symptoms don't occur order"", ' may infected syphilis noticing symptoms years', ' primary syphilis first sign syphilis small sore', ' called chancre (shang-kur)', ' sore spot bacteria entered body', ' people infected syphilis develop only chancre', ' people develop them', ' chancre develops weeks exposure', "" people who syphilis don't notice chancre it's painless"", ' may hidden vagina rectum', ' chancre will heal weeks', ' secondary syphilis weeks original chancre healing', ' may experience rash begins trunk eventually covers entire body — palms hands soles feet', ' rash itchy may accompanied wartlike sores mouth genital area', ' people experience hair loss', ' muscle aches', ' fever', ' sore throat swollen lymph nodes', ' signs symptoms may disappear weeks repeatedly come long year', "" latent syphilis aren't treated syphilis"", ' disease moves secondary stage hidden (latent) stage', ' symptoms', ' latent stage can last years', ' signs symptoms may return', ' disease may progress third (tertiary) stage', "" tertiary syphilis 15% 30% people infected syphilis who don't treatment will develop complications known tertiary syphilis"", ' late stage', ' disease may damage brain', ' nerves', ' eyes', ' heart', ' blood vessels', ' liver', ' bones joints', ' problems may occur years original', ' untreated infection', ' neurosyphilis stage', ' syphilis can spread and', ' damage', ' cause damage brain nervous system eye', ' congenital syphilis babies born women who syphilis can infected placenta birth', ' newborns congenital syphilis symptoms', ' experience rash palms hands soles feet', ' later signs symptoms may include deafness', ' teeth deformities saddle nose — bridge nose collapses', ' however', ' babies born syphilis can born early', ' may die womb birth can die birth', '']",['syphilis']

Paget's disease of the breast affects your nipple and usually the skin (areola) surrounding it. It's easy to mistake the signs and symptoms of Paget's disease of the breast for skin irritation (dermatitis) or another noncancerous (benign) skin condition. Possible signs and symptoms of Paget's disease of the breast include:  Flaky or scaly skin on your nipple Crusty, oozing or hardened skin resembling eczema on the nipple, areola or both Itching Redness A tingling or burning sensation Straw-colored or bloody nipple discharge A flattened or turned-in (inverted) nipple A lump in the breast Thickening skin on the breast  Signs and symptoms usually occur in one breast only. The disease typically starts in the nipple and may spread to the areola and other areas of the breast. The skin changes may come and go early on or respond to topical treatment, making it appear as if your skin is healing.

"Huntington's disease usually causes movement, cognitive and psychiatric disorders with a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms. Which symptoms appear first varies greatly from person to person. Some symptoms appear more dominant or have a greater effect on functional ability, but that can change throughout the course of the disease. Movement disorders The movement disorders associated with Huntington's disease can include both involuntary movement problems and impairments in voluntary movements, such as:  Involuntary jerking or writhing movements (chorea) Muscle problems, such as rigidity or muscle contracture (dystonia) Slow or unusual eye movements Impaired gait, posture and balance Difficulty with speech or swallowing  Impairments in voluntary movements — rather than involuntary movements — may have a greater impact on a person's ability to work, perform daily activities, communicate and remain independent. Cognitive disorders Cognitive impairments often associated with Huntington's disease include:  Difficulty organizing, prioritizing or focusing on tasks Lack of flexibility or the tendency to get stuck on a thought, behavior or action (perseveration) Lack of impulse control that can result in outbursts, acting without thinking and sexual promiscuity Lack of awareness of one's own behaviors and abilities Slowness in processing thoughts or ''finding'' words Difficulty in learning new information  Psychiatric disorders The most common psychiatric disorder associated with Huntington's disease is depression. This isn't simply a reaction to receiving a diagnosis of Huntington's disease. Instead, depression appears to occur because of injury to the brain and subsequent changes in brain function. Signs and symptoms may include:  Feelings of irritability, sadness or apathy Social withdrawal Insomnia Fatigue and loss of energy Frequent thoughts of death, dying or suicide  Other common psychiatric disorders include:  Obsessive-compulsive disorder, a condition marked by recurrent, intrusive thoughts and repetitive behaviors Mania, which can cause elevated mood, overactivity, impulsive behavior and inflated self-esteem Bipolar disorder, a condition with alternating episodes of depression and mania  In addition to the above disorders, weight loss is common in people with Huntington's disease, especially as the disease progresses. Symptoms of juvenile Huntington's disease The start and progression of Huntington's disease in younger people may be slightly different from that in adults. Problems that often present early in the course of the disease include: Behavioral changes  Difficulty paying attention Rapid, significant drop in overall school performance Behavioral problems  Physical changes  Contracted and rigid muscles that affect gait (especially in young children) Tremors or slight involuntary movements Frequent falls or clumsiness Seizures ",490.0,"[""huntington's disease causes movement"", ' cognitive psychiatric disorders wide spectrum signs symptoms', ' symptoms first varies greatly person person', ' symptoms dominant greater effect functional ability', ' can change course disease', "" movement disorders movement disorders associated huntington's disease can include involuntary movement problems impairments voluntary movements"", ' as:  involuntary jerking writhing movements (chorea) muscle problems', ' rigidity muscle contracture (dystonia) slow unusual eye movements impaired gait', "" posture balance difficulty speech swallowing  impairments voluntary movements — involuntary movements — may greater impact person's ability work"", ' perform daily activities', ' communicate remain independent', "" cognitive disorders cognitive impairments associated huntington's disease include:  difficulty organizing"", ' prioritizing focusing tasks lack flexibility tendency stuck thought', ' behavior action (perseveration) lack impulse control can result outbursts', "" acting thinking sexual promiscuity lack awareness one's behaviors abilities slowness processing thoughts ''finding'' words difficulty learning new  psychiatric disorders common psychiatric disorder associated huntington's disease depression"", "" isn't simply reaction receiving diagnosis huntington's disease"", ' instead', ' depression occur injury brain subsequent changes brain function', ' signs symptoms may include:  feelings irritability', ' sadness apathy social withdrawal insomnia fatigue loss energy frequent thoughts death', ' dying suicide  common psychiatric disorders include:  obsessive-compulsive disorder', ' condition marked recurrent', ' intrusive thoughts repetitive behaviors mania', ' can cause elevated mood', ' overactivity', ' impulsive behavior inflated self-esteem bipolar disorder', ' condition alternating episodes depression mania  addition disorders', "" weight loss common people huntington's disease"", ' especially disease progresses', "" symptoms juvenile huntington's disease start progression huntington's disease younger people may slightly adults"", ' problems present early course disease include: behavioral changes  difficulty paying attention rapid', ' significant drop school performance behavioral problems  physical changes  contracted rigid muscles affect gait (especially young children) tremors slight involuntary movements frequent falls clumsiness seizures ']",['huntingtons disease']

"The most common symptom associated with the yips is an involuntary muscle jerk, although some people experience tremors, twitches, spasms or freezing. Causes In some people, the yips are a type of focal dystonia, a condition that causes involuntary muscle contractions during a specific task. It's most likely related to overuse of a certain set of muscles, similar to writer's cramp. Anxiety worsens the effect. Some athletes become so anxious and self-focused — overthinking to the point of distraction — that their ability to execute a skill, such as putting, is impaired. ""Choking"" is an extreme form of performance anxiety that may compromise a golfer's or any athlete's game.

"Because epilepsy is caused by abnormal activity in the brain, seizures can affect any process your brain coordinates. Seizure signs and symptoms may include:  Temporary confusion A staring spell Stiff muscles Uncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs Loss of consciousness or awareness Psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu  Symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. In most cases, a person with epilepsy will tend to have the same type of seizure each time, so the symptoms will be similar from episode to episode. Doctors generally classify seizures as either focal or generalized, based on how and where the abnormal brain activity begins. Focal seizures When seizures appear to result from abnormal activity in just one area of your brain, they're called focal seizures. These seizures fall into two categories:  Focal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. Some people experience deja vu. This type of seizure may also result in involuntary jerking of one body part, such as an arm or leg, and spontaneous sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights. Focal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness. This type of seizure may seem like being in a dream. During a focal seizure with impaired awareness, you may stare into space and not respond normally to your environment or perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles.  Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological disorders, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough examination and testing are needed to distinguish epilepsy from other disorders. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Six types of generalized seizures exist.  Absence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, typically occur in children. They're characterized by staring into space with or without subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking and only last between 5-10 seconds. These seizures may occur in clusters, happening as often as 100 times per day, and cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiff muscles and may affect consciousness. These seizures usually affect muscles in your back, arms and legs and may cause you to fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control. Since this most often affects the legs, it often causes you to suddenly collapse or fall down. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic, jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches and usually affect the upper body, arms and legs. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure. They can cause an abrupt loss of consciousness and body stiffening, twitching and shaking. They sometimes cause loss of bladder control or biting your tongue.

"Signs and symptoms — other than short stature — vary considerably across the spectrum of disorders. Disproportionate dwarfism Most people with dwarfism have disorders that cause disproportionately short stature. Usually, this means that a person has an average-size trunk and very short limbs, but some people may have a very short trunk and shortened (but disproportionately large) limbs. In these disorders, the head is disproportionately large compared with the body. Almost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have normal intellectual capacities. Rare exceptions are usually the result of a secondary factor, such as excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus). The most common cause of dwarfism is a disorder called achondroplasia, which causes disproportionately short stature. This disorder usually results in the following:  An average-size trunk Short arms and legs, with particularly short upper arms and upper legs Short fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring fingers Limited mobility at the elbows A disproportionately large head, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose Progressive development of bowed legs Progressive development of swayed lower back An adult height around 4 feet (122 cm)  Another cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Signs may include:  A very short trunk A short neck Shortened arms and legs Average-size hands and feet Broad, rounded chest Slightly flattened cheekbones Opening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) Hip deformities that result in thighbones turning inward A foot that's twisted or out of shape Instability of the neck bones Progressive hunching curvature of the upper spine Progressive development of swayed lower back Vision and hearing problems Arthritis and problems with joint movement Adult height ranging from 3 feet (91 cm) to just over 4 feet (122 cm)  Proportionate dwarfism Proportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth and development. So the head, trunk and limbs are all small, but they're proportionate to each other. Because these disorders affect overall growth, many of them result in poor development of one or more body systems. Growth hormone deficiency is a relatively common cause of proportionate dwarfism.

"The average time from infection to appearance of signs and symptoms (incubation period) is 10 days. The incubation period can range from 3 to 21 days. The most common type of tetanus is called generalized tetanus. Signs and symptoms begin gradually and then progressively worsen over two weeks. They usually start at the jaw and progress downward on the body. Signs and symptoms of generalized tetanus include:  Painful muscle spasms and stiff, immovable muscles (muscle rigidity) in your jaw Tension of muscles around your lips, sometimes producing a persistent grin Painful spasms and rigidity in your neck muscles Difficulty swallowing Rigid abdominal muscles  Progression of tetanus results in repeated painful, seizure-like spasms that last for several minutes (generalized spasms). Usually, the neck and back arch, the legs become rigid, the arms are drawn up to the body, and the fists are clenched. Muscle rigidity in the neck and abdomen may cause breathing difficulties. These severe spasms may be triggered by minor events that stimulate the senses — a loud sound, a physical touch, a draft or light. As the disease progresses, other signs and symptoms may include:  High blood pressure Low blood pressure Rapid heart rate Fever Extreme sweating  Localized tetanus This uncommon form of tetanus results in muscles spasms near the site of a wound. While it's usually a less severe form of disease, it can progress to generalized tetanus. Cephalic tetanus This rare form of tetanus results from a head wound.

"Symptoms vary, depending on the type of eating disorder. Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder are the most common eating disorders. Other eating disorders include rumination disorder and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Anorexia nervosa Anorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh) nervosa — often simply called anorexia — is a potentially life-threatening eating disorder characterized by an abnormally low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted perception of weight or shape. People with anorexia use extreme efforts to control their weight and shape, which often significantly interferes with their health and life activities. When you have anorexia, you excessively limit calories or use other methods to lose weight, such as excessive exercise, using laxatives or diet aids, or vomiting after eating. Efforts to reduce your weight, even when underweight, can cause severe health problems, sometimes to the point of deadly self-starvation. Bulimia nervosa Bulimia (boo-LEE-me-uh) nervosa — commonly called bulimia — is a serious, potentially life-threatening eating disorder. When you have bulimia, you have episodes of bingeing and purging that involve feeling a lack of control over your eating. Many people with bulimia also restrict their eating during the day, which often leads to more binge eating and purging. During these episodes, you typically eat a large amount of food in a short time, and then try to rid yourself of the extra calories in an unhealthy way. Because of guilt, shame and an intense fear of weight gain from overeating, you may force vomiting or you may exercise too much or use other methods, such as laxatives, to get rid of the calories. If you have bulimia, you're probably preoccupied with your weight and body shape, and may judge yourself severely and harshly for your self-perceived flaws. You may be at a normal weight or even a bit overweight. Binge-eating disorder When you have binge-eating disorder, you regularly eat too much food (binge) and feel a lack of control over your eating. You may eat quickly or eat more food than intended, even when you're not hungry, and you may continue eating even long after you're uncomfortably full. After a binge, you may feel guilty, disgusted or ashamed by your behavior and the amount of food eaten. But you don't try to compensate for this behavior with excessive exercise or purging, as someone with bulimia or anorexia might. Embarrassment can lead to eating alone to hide your bingeing. A new round of bingeing usually occurs at least once a week. You may be normal weight, overweight or obese. Rumination disorder Rumination disorder is repeatedly and persistently regurgitating food after eating, but it's not due to a medical condition or another eating disorder such as anorexia, bulimia or binge-eating disorder. Food is brought back up into the mouth without nausea or gagging, and regurgitation may not be intentional. Sometimes regurgitated food is rechewed and reswallowed or spit out. The disorder may result in malnutrition if the food is spit out or if the person eats significantly less to prevent the behavior. The occurrence of rumination disorder may be more common in infancy or in people who have an intellectual disability. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder This disorder is characterized by failing to meet your minimum daily nutrition requirements because you don't have an interest in eating; you avoid food with certain sensory characteristics, such as color, texture, smell or taste; or you're concerned about the consequences of eating, such as fear of choking. Food is not avoided because of fear of gaining weight.

The adults then produce larvae that move through the bloodstream to muscle tissues, shown here. Signs and symptoms of trichinosis infection and how severe the infection is can vary. This depends on the number of larvae eaten in the infected meat. Possibly no signs or symptoms Mild cases of trichinosis — those with only a small number of parasites in your body — may cause no signs or symptoms. Symptoms can develop with moderate or heavy infestation ⸺ a large number of parasites in your body. These symptoms sometimes get worse as the roundworm (trichinella) larvae travel through your body. Initial signs and symptoms You swallow roundworm (trichinella) larvae in tiny sacks (cysts) containing the parasite. Your digestive juices dissolve the cysts, releasing the larvae into your body. The larvae then enter the wall of your small intestine, where they grow into adult worms and mate. Digestive symptoms can begin 1 to 2 days after infection. At this stage, you may experience:  Diarrhea Stomach (abdominal) pain Severe tiredness and weakness (fatigue) Nausea and vomiting  Later signs and symptoms About a week after infection, the adult female worms produce larvae. The larvae go through the wall of your intestine and enter your bloodstream, They travel around the body and bury themselves in muscle tissue. Here, each larva coils up and forms a cyst around itself. The larvae can live for months to years inside the muscle tissue. Symptoms caused by muscle tissue invasion usually start 2 to 8 weeks after infection and include:  High fever and chills Muscle pain and tenderness Aching joints Swelling of the eyelids or face Weakness Headache Sensitivity to light Pink eye (conjunctivitis) Itchy, irritated skin  With a large number of parasites, muscle pain and weakness can be severe. This can limit moving, breathing and speaking. Symptoms last for several months. But symptoms generally lessen when the larvae form cysts.

"Common anxiety signs and symptoms include:  Feeling nervous, restless or tense Having a sense of impending danger, panic or doom Having an increased heart rate Breathing rapidly (hyperventilation) Sweating Trembling Feeling weak or tired Trouble concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry Having trouble sleeping Experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) problems Having difficulty controlling worry Having the urge to avoid things that trigger anxiety  Several types of anxiety disorders exist:  Agoraphobia (ag-uh-ruh-FOE-be-uh) is a type of anxiety disorder in which you fear and often avoid places or situations that might cause you to panic and make you feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed. Anxiety disorder due to a medical condition includes symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are directly caused by a physical health problem. Generalized anxiety disorder includes persistent and excessive anxiety and worry about activities or events — even ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other anxiety disorders or depression. Panic disorder involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense anxiety and fear or terror that reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom, shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred. Selective mutism is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning. Separation anxiety disorder is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others. Specific phobias are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people. Substance-induced anxiety disorder is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs.  Other specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive.

"Priapism symptoms vary depending on the type of priapism. The two main types of priapism are ischemic priapism and nonischemic priapism. Ischemic priapism Ischemic priapism, also called low-flow priapism, is the result of blood not being able to leave the penis. Blood is trapped in the penis because it cannot flow out of the veins of the penis or there is a problem with the contraction of smooth muscles within the erectile tissue of the penis. Ischemic priapism is the more common type of priapism and requires immediate medical care to prevent complications caused by not getting enough oxygen to the penile tissue. Signs and symptoms include:  Erection lasting more than four hours or unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation Rigid penile shaft, but the tip of penis (glans) is soft Progressively worsening penile pain  Stuttering priapism — also called recurrent or intermittent priapism — is a form of ischemic priapism. An uncommon condition, stuttering priapism describes repetitive episodes of prolonged erections and often includes episodes of ischemic priapism. It occurs more often in males who have an inherited disorder characterized by abnormally shaped red blood cells (sickle cell disease). Sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis. In some cases, the condition starts off with unwanted and painful erections of short duration and might progress over time to more-frequent and more-prolonged erections. Stuttering priapism may begin in childhood. Nonischemic priapism Nonischemic priapism, also known as high-flow priapism, occurs when blood flow through the arteries of the penis isn't working properly. However, the penile tissues continue to receive some blood flow and oxygen. Nonischemic priapism often occurs due to trauma.

A true milk allergy differs from milk protein intolerance and lactose intolerance. Unlike milk allergy, intolerance doesn't involve the immune system. Milk intolerance requires different treatment from true milk allergy. Common signs and symptoms of milk protein intolerance or lactose intolerance include digestive problems, such as bloating, gas or diarrhea, after consuming milk or products containing milk. Anaphylaxis Milk allergy can cause anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction that narrows the airways and can block breathing. Milk is the third most common food — after peanuts and tree nuts — to cause anaphylaxis. If you or your child has a reaction to milk, tell your health care provider, no matter how mild the reaction. Tests can help confirm milk allergy, so you can avoid future and potentially worse reactions. Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency and requires treatment with an epinephrine (adrenaline) shot (EpiPen, Adrenaclick, others) and a trip to the emergency room.

"Primary progressive aphasia symptoms vary, depending on which portion of the brain's language areas are involved. The condition has three types, which cause different symptoms. Semantic variant primary progressive aphasia Signs and symptoms include:  Difficulty comprehending spoken or written language, particularly single words Trouble comprehending word meanings Struggling to name objects  Logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia Signs and symptoms include:  Difficulty retrieving words and word substitutions Frequently pausing in speech while searching for words Difficulty repeating phrases or sentences  Nonfluent-agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia Signs and symptoms include:   Poor grammar in written and spoken form Trouble understanding complex sentences Using grammar incorrectly May be accompanied by speaking problems such as errors in speech sounds (known as apraxia of speech)  Causes Primary progressive aphasia is caused by a shrinking (atrophy) of certain sections (lobes) of the brain responsible for speech and language. In this case, the frontal, temporal or parietal lobes, primarily on the left side of the brain, are affected. Atrophy is associated with the presence of abnormal proteins, and brain activity or function in affected areas might be reduced. Risk factors Risk factors for primary progressive aphasia include:  Learning disabilities. If you had a childhood learning disability, particularly developmental dyslexia, you might be at somewhat higher risk of primary progressive aphasia. Certain gene mutations. Rare gene mutations have been linked to the disorder. If other members of your family have had primary progressive aphasia, you might be more likely to develop it.  Complications People with primary progressive aphasia eventually lose the ability to speak and write, and to understand written and spoken language. Some people develop substantial difficulty forming sounds to speak (a problem called apraxia of speech), even when their ability to write and comprehend are not significantly impaired. As the disease progresses, other mental skills, such as memory, can become impaired. Some people develop other neurological symptoms such as problems with movement. With these complications, the affected person eventually will need help with day-to-day care. People with primary progressive aphasia can also develop depression or behavioral or social problems as the disease progresses. Other problems might include blunted emotions such as unconcern, poor judgment or inappropriate social behavior.

Most sacral dimples are small and shallow. A sacral dimple is an indentation or pit in the skin on the lower back. It's usually located just above the crease between the buttocks. Causes There are no known causes for a sacral dimple. It is a congenital condition, meaning it's present at birth. Complications Rarely, sacral dimples are associated with a serious underlying abnormality of the spine or spinal cord. Examples include:  Spina bifida. A very mild form of this condition, called spina bifida occulta, occurs when the spine doesn't close properly around the spinal cord, but the cord remains within the spinal canal. In most cases, spina bifida occulta causes no symptoms and doesn't need treatment. Tethered cord syndrome. The spinal cord normally hangs freely within the spinal canal. Tethered cord syndrome is a disorder that occurs when tissue attached to the spinal cord limits its movements. Signs and symptoms may include weakness or numbness in the legs and bladder or bowel incontinence.  The risks of these spinal problems increase if the sacral dimple is accompanied by a nearby tuft of hair, skin tag or lump, and certain types of skin discoloration                  By Mayo Clinic Staff By Mayo Clinic Staff Request an appointment Request an appointment   Diagnosis & treatment Diagnosis & treatment Diagnosis & treatment       Oct. 07, 2022   Print Print  Share on: FacebookTwitter Facebook Twitter Show references Paller AS, et al.

Adrenal cancer forms when something creates changes (mutations) in the DNA of an adrenal gland cell. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. The mutations can tell the cell to multiply uncontrollably and to continue living when healthy cells would die. When this happens, the abnormal cells accumulate and form a tumor. The tumor cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body.

But because they shed cholera bacteria in their stool for seven to 14 days, they can still infect others through contaminated water. Most cases of cholera that cause symptoms cause mild or moderate diarrhea that's often hard to tell apart from diarrhea caused by other problems. Others develop more-serious signs and symptoms of cholera, usually within a few days of infection. Symptoms of cholera infection can include:  Diarrhea. Cholera-related diarrhea comes on suddenly and can quickly cause dangerous fluid loss — as much as a quart (about 1 liter) an hour. Diarrhea due to cholera often has a pale, milky appearance that resembles water in which rice has been rinsed. Nausea and vomiting. Vomiting occurs especially in the early stages of cholera and can last for hours. Dehydration. Dehydration can develop within hours after cholera symptoms start and range from mild to severe. A loss of 10% or more of body weight indicates severe dehydration. Signs and symptoms of cholera dehydration include irritability, fatigue, sunken eyes, a dry mouth, extreme thirst, dry and shriveled skin that's slow to bounce back when pinched into a fold, little or no urinating, low blood pressure, and an irregular heartbeat.   Dehydration can lead to a rapid loss of minerals in your blood that maintain the balance of fluids in your body. This is called an electrolyte imbalance. Electrolyte imbalance An electrolyte imbalance can lead to serious signs and symptoms such as:  Muscle cramps. These result from the rapid loss of salts such as sodium, chloride and potassium. Shock. This is one of the most serious complications of dehydration. It occurs when low blood volume causes a drop in blood pressure and a drop in the amount of oxygen in your body. If untreated, severe hypovolemic shock can cause death in minutes.

This melanoma shows color variations and an irregular border, both of which are melanoma warning signs. Melanomas can develop anywhere on your body. They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face. Melanomas can also occur in areas that don't receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin. The first melanoma signs and symptoms often are:  A change in an existing mole The development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin  Melanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin. Normal moles Normal moles are generally a uniform color — such as tan, brown or black — with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They're oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Most moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma To help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE:  A is for asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves. B is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders — characteristics of melanomas. C is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters). E is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding.  Cancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics. Hidden melanomas Melanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn't think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area. Hidden melanomas include:  Melanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It's more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment. Melanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions. Melanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea — the layer beneath the white of the eye (sclera). An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam.

During prenatal visits, your health care provider might measure your fundal height — the distance from the top of your uterus to your pubic bone. A larger than expected fundal height could be a sign of fetal macrosomia.  Excessive amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios). Having too much amniotic fluid — the fluid that surrounds and protects a baby during pregnancy — might be a sign that your baby is larger than average.      The amount of amniotic fluid reflects your baby's urine output, and a larger baby produces more urine. Some conditions that cause a baby to be larger might also increase his or her urine output.

When warts do appear, they vary in appearance depending on which kind of HPV is involved: HPV HPV   Genital warts. These appear as flat lesions, small cauliflower-like bumps or tiny stemlike protrusions. In women, genital warts appear mostly on the vulva but can also occur near the anus, on the cervix or in the vagina. In men, genital warts appear on the penis and scrotum or around the anus. Genital warts rarely cause discomfort or pain, though they may itch or feel tender.  Common warts. Common warts appear as rough, raised bumps and usually occur on the hands and fingers. In most cases, common warts are simply unsightly, but they can also be painful or susceptible to injury or bleeding. Plantar warts. Plantar warts are hard, grainy growths that usually appear on the heels or balls of your feet. These warts might cause discomfort. Flat warts. Flat warts are flat-topped, slightly raised lesions. They can appear anywhere, but children usually get them on the face and men tend to get them in the beard area. Women tend to get them on the legs.  Cervical cancer Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by HPV infections, but cervical cancer may take 20 years or longer to develop after an HPV infection. The HPV infection and early cervical cancer typically don't cause noticeable symptoms. Getting vaccinated against HPV infection is your best protection from cervical cancer. HPV HPV HPV HPV Because early cervical cancer doesn't cause symptoms, it's vital that women have regular screening tests to detect any precancerous changes in the cervix that might lead to cancer. Current guidelines recommend that women ages 21 to 29 have a Pap test every three years. Women ages 30 to 65 are advised to continue having a Pap test every three years, or every five years if they also get the HPV DNA test at the same time. Women over 65 can stop testing if they've had three normal Pap tests in a row, or two HPV DNA and Pap tests with no abnormal results.",489.0,"['           common warts       open pop-up dialog box

"The most common sign of Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a heart rate greater than 100 beats a minute. Episodes of a fast heart rate (tachycardia) can begin suddenly and may last a few seconds or several hours. Episodes can occur during exercise or while at rest. Other signs and symptoms of WPW syndrome are related to the fast heart rate and underlying heart rhythm problem (arrhythmia). The most common arrhythmia seen with WPW syndrome is supraventricular tachycardia. Supraventricular tachycardia causes episodes of a fast, pounding heartbeat that begin and end abruptly.

"Signs and symptoms of acoustic neuroma are often easy to miss and may take many years to develop. They usually happen because of the tumor's effects on the hearing and balance nerves. Pressure from the tumor on nearby nerves controlling facial muscles and sensation (facial and trigeminal nerves), nearby blood vessels, or brain structures may also cause problems. As the tumor grows, it may cause more noticeable or severe signs and symptoms.

"Signs and symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease may include:  Weakness in your legs, ankles and feet Loss of muscle bulk in your legs and feet High foot arches Curled toes (hammertoes) Decreased ability to run Difficulty lifting your foot at the ankle (footdrop) Awkward or higher than normal step (gait) Frequent tripping or falling Decreased sensation or a loss of feeling in your legs and feet  As Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease progresses, symptoms may spread from the feet and legs to the hands and arms. The severity of symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, even among family members. Causes Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is an inherited, genetic condition. It occurs when there are mutations in the genes that affect the nerves in your feet, legs, hands and arms. Sometimes, these mutations damage the nerves. Other mutations damage the protective coating that surrounds the nerve (myelin sheath). Both cause weaker messages to travel between your limbs and brain. Risk factors Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is hereditary, so you're at higher risk of developing the disorder if anyone in your immediate family has the disease. Other causes of neuropathies, such as diabetes, may cause symptoms similar to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. These other conditions can also cause the symptoms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease to become worse. Medications such as the chemotherapy drugs vincristine (Marqibo), paclitaxel (Abraxane) and others can make symptoms worse. Be sure to let your doctor know about all of the medications you're taking. Complications Complications of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease vary in severity from person to person. Foot abnormalities and difficulty walking are usually the most serious problems. Muscles may get weaker, and you may injure areas of the body that experience decreased sensation. Sometimes the muscles in your feet may not receive your brain's signal to contract, so you're more likely to trip and fall. And your brain may not receive pain messages from your feet, so if you've rubbed a blister on your toe, for example, it may get infected without your realizing it. You may also experience difficulty breathing, swallowing or speaking if the muscles that control these functions are affected by Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

"Most septal displacements result in no symptoms, and you may not even know you have a deviated septum. Some septal deformities, however, may cause the following signs and symptoms:  Obstruction of one or both nostrils. This blockage can make it difficult to breathe through the nostril or nostrils. You may notice this more when you have a cold or allergies that can cause your nasal passages to swell and narrow. Nosebleeds. The surface of your nasal septum may become dry, increasing your risk of nosebleeds. Facial pain. There is some debate about the possible nasal causes of facial pain. A possible cause of one-sided facial pain could be a severe deviated septum in which surfaces within the nose touch and cause pressure. Noisy breathing during sleep. A deviated septum or swelling of the tissues in your nose can be one of the many reasons for noisy breathing during sleep. Awareness of the nasal cycle. The nose alternates between being obstructed on one side and then changes to being obstructed on the other. This is called the nasal cycle. Being aware of the nasal cycle isn't typical and can indicate nasal obstruction. Preference for sleeping on a particular side. Some people may prefer to sleep on a particular side to optimize breathing through the nose at night if one nasal passage is narrowed.

"There are many different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but the most common signs and symptoms include:  Overly flexible joints. Because the connective tissue that holds joints together is looser, your joints can move far past the normal range of motion. Joint pain and dislocations are common. Stretchy skin. Weakened connective tissue allows your skin to stretch much more than usual. You may be able to pull a pinch of skin up away from your flesh, but it will snap right back into place when you let go. Your skin might also feel exceptionally soft and velvety. Fragile skin. Damaged skin often doesn't heal well. For example, the stitches used to close a wound often will tear out and leave a gaping scar. These scars may look thin and crinkly.  Symptom severity can vary from person to person and depends on the specific type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that you have. The most common type is called hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome often share distinctive facial features of a thin nose, thin upper lip, small earlobes and prominent eyes. They also have thin, translucent skin that bruises very easily. In fair-skinned people, the underlying blood vessels are very visible through the skin. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can weaken your heart's largest artery (aorta), as well as the arteries to other regions of your body. A rupture of any of these larger blood vessels can be fatal. The vascular type can also weaken the walls of the uterus or large intestines — which also may rupture. Causes Different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are associated with a variety of genetic causes, some of which are inherited and passed on from parent to child. If you have the most common form, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, there's a 50% chance that you'll pass on the gene to each of your children. Complications Complications depend on the types of signs and symptoms you have. For example, overly flexible joints can result in joint dislocations and early-onset arthritis. Fragile skin may develop prominent scarring. People who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are at risk of often fatal ruptures of major blood vessels. Some organs, such as the uterus and intestines, also may rupture. Pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus. Prevention If you have a personal or family history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and you're thinking about starting a family, you may benefit from talking to a genetic counselor — a health care professional trained to assess the risk of inherited disorders. Genetic counseling can help you understand the inheritance pattern of the type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that affects you and the risks it poses for your children.

Adults usually develop heat rash in skin folds and where clothing rubs against the skin. In infants, the rash is mainly found on the neck, shoulders and chest. It can also show up in the armpits, elbow creases and groin. Types of heat rash The types of heat rash are classified according to how deep the sweat is trapped in the skin. Signs and symptoms for each type vary.  The mildest form of heat rash is called miliaria crystallina. It occurs when the opening of the sweat duct on the surface of the skin (sweat pore) is blocked. This form is marked by tiny, clear, fluid-filled bumps that break easily. A type that occurs deeper in the skin is called miliaria rubra. It is sometimes called prickly heat. Signs and symptoms include small, inflamed blister-like bumps and itching or prickling in the affected area. Occasionally, the inflamed bumps of miliaria rubra fill with pus. This form is called miliaria pustulosa. A less common form of heat rash is called miliaria profunda. It affects the deepest layer of the skin (dermis). It causes firm, painful or itchy inflamed bumps that look like goose bumps and may break open.

"Signs and symptoms of frontotemporal dementia can be different from one individual to the next. Signs and symptoms get progressively worse over time, usually over years. Clusters of symptom types tend to occur together, and people may have more than one cluster of symptom types. Behavioral changes The most common signs of frontotemporal dementia involve extreme changes in behavior and personality. These include:  Increasingly inappropriate social behavior Loss of empathy and other interpersonal skills, such as having sensitivity to another's feelings Lack of judgment Loss of inhibition Lack of interest (apathy), which can be mistaken for depression Repetitive compulsive behavior, such as tapping, clapping or smacking lips A decline in personal hygiene Changes in eating habits, usually overeating or developing a preference for sweets and carbohydrates Eating inedible objects Compulsively wanting to put things in the mouth  Speech and language problems Some subtypes of frontotemporal dementia lead to language problems or impairment or loss of speech. Primary progressive aphasia, semantic dementia and progressive agrammatic (nonfluent) aphasia are all considered to be frontotemporal dementia. Problems caused by these conditions include:  Increasing difficulty in using and understanding written and spoken language, such as having trouble finding the right word to use in speech or naming objects Trouble naming things, possibly replacing a specific word with a more general word such as ""it"" for pen No longer knowing word meanings Having hesitant speech that may sound telegraphic Making mistakes in sentence construction  Motor disorders Rarer subtypes of frontotemporal dementia are characterized by problems with movement similar to those associated with Parkinson's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Motor-related problems may include:  Tremor Rigidity Muscle spasms or twitches Poor coordination Difficulty swallowing Muscle weakness Inappropriate laughing or crying Falls or walking problems  Causes In frontotemporal dementia, the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain shrink. In addition, certain substances accumulate in the brain. What causes these changes is usually unknown. There are genetic mutations that have been linked to frontotemporal dementia. But more than half of the people who develop frontotemporal dementia have no family history of dementia. Recently, researchers have confirmed shared genetics and molecular pathways between frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). More research needs to be done to understand the connection between these conditions, however. Risk factors Your risk of developing frontotemporal dementia is higher if you have a family history of dementia. There are no other known risk factors.

Egg allergy symptoms can include:  Skin inflammation or hives — the most common egg allergy reaction Nasal congestion, runny nose and sneezing (allergic rhinitis) Digestive symptoms, such as cramps, nausea and vomiting Asthma signs and symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, chest tightness or shortness of breath  Anaphylaxis A severe allergic reaction can lead to anaphylaxis, a life-threatening emergency that requires an immediate epinephrine (adrenaline) shot and a trip to the emergency room. Anaphylaxis signs and symptoms include:  Constriction of airways, including a swollen throat or a lump in your throat that makes it difficult to breathe Abdominal pain and cramping Rapid pulse Shock, with a severe drop in blood pressure felt as dizziness, lightheadedness or loss of consciousness  Discuss with your doctor any reaction — no matter how mild — you or your child has to eggs. The severity of egg allergy reactions can vary each time one occurs, so even if a past reaction was mild, the next one could be more serious. If your doctor thinks you or your child may be at risk of a severe reaction, he or she may prescribe an emergency epinephrine shot to be used if anaphylaxis occurs.

"The typical mole is a small brown spot. But moles come in different colors, shapes and sizes:  Color and texture. Moles can be brown, tan, black, blue, red or pink. They can be smooth, wrinkled, flat or raised. They may have hair growing from them. Shape. Most moles are oval or round. Size. Moles are usually less than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter — the size of a pencil eraser. Those present at birth (congenital nevi) can be bigger than usual, covering part of the face, torso or a limb.  Moles can develop anywhere on your body, including your scalp, armpits, under your nails, and between your fingers and toes. Most people have 10 to 40 moles. Many of these develop by age 50. Moles may change or fade away over time. With hormonal changes in adolescence and pregnancy, they may become darker and larger. Clusters of brown spots around the eyes, cheeks and nose are sometimes called flesh moles, but they are actually dermatoses papulosa nigra — a type of seborrheic keratosis, not clusters of pigment-forming cells (nevi). Dermatoses papulosa nigra are more common among Black women. Flesh moles don't carry a risk of melanoma, but they can be treated if you consider them a cosmetic concern. Unusual moles that may indicate melanoma A mole may be a sign of skin cancer if it has irregular borders or an asymmetrical shape or if it changes in color, shape, size or height. This ABCDE guide can help you remember what to watch for: ABCDE  A is for asymmetrical shape. One half is unlike the other half. B is for border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders. C is for color. Look for growths that have changed color, have many colors or have uneven color. D is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters). E is for evolving. Watch for moles that change in size, shape, color or height. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as itchiness or bleeding.  Cancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above. Others may have only one or two unusual characteristics.

"Drug addiction symptoms or behaviors include, among others:  Feeling that you have to use the drug regularly — daily or even several times a day Having intense urges for the drug that block out any other thoughts Over time, needing more of the drug to get the same effect Taking larger amounts of the drug over a longer period of time than you intended Making certain that you maintain a supply of the drug Spending money on the drug, even though you can't afford it Not meeting obligations and work responsibilities, or cutting back on social or recreational activities because of drug use Continuing to use the drug, even though you know it's causing problems in your life or causing you physical or psychological harm Doing things to get the drug that you normally wouldn't do, such as stealing Driving or doing other risky activities when you're under the influence of the drug Spending a good deal of time getting the drug, using the drug or recovering from the effects of the drug Failing in your attempts to stop using the drug Experiencing withdrawal symptoms when you attempt to stop taking the drug  Recognizing unhealthy drug use in family members Sometimes it's difficult to distinguish normal teenage moodiness or anxiety from signs of drug use. Possible signs that your teenager or other family member is using drugs include:  Problems at school or work — frequently missing school or work, a sudden disinterest in school activities or work, or a drop in grades or work performance Physical health issues — lack of energy and motivation, weight loss or gain, or red eyes Neglected appearance — lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks Changes in behavior — major efforts to bar family members from entering the teenager's room or being secretive about going out with friends; or drastic changes in behavior and in relationships with family and friends Money issues — sudden requests for money without a reasonable explanation; or your discovery that money is missing or has been stolen or that items have disappeared from your home, indicating maybe they're being sold to support drug use  Recognizing signs of drug use or intoxication Signs and symptoms of drug use or intoxication may vary, depending on the type of drug. Below you'll find several examples. Marijuana, hashish and other cannabis-containing substances People use cannabis by smoking, eating or inhaling a vaporized form of the drug. Cannabis often precedes or is used along with other substances, such as alcohol or illegal drugs, and is often the first drug tried. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include:  A sense of euphoria or feeling ""high"" A heightened sense of visual, auditory and taste perception Increased blood pressure and heart rate Red eyes Dry mouth Decreased coordination Difficulty concentrating or remembering Slowed reaction time Anxiety or paranoid thinking Cannabis odor on clothes or yellow fingertips Major cravings for certain foods at unusual times  Long-term use is often associated with:  Decreased mental sharpness Poor performance at school or at work Ongoing cough and frequent lung infections  K2, Spice and bath salts Two groups of synthetic drugs — synthetic cannabinoids and substituted or synthetic cathinones — are illegal in most states. The effects of these drugs can be dangerous and unpredictable, as there is no quality control and some ingredients may not be known. Synthetic cannabinoids, also called K2 or Spice, are sprayed on dried herbs and then smoked, but can be prepared as an herbal tea. A liquid form can be vaporized in electronic cigarettes. Despite manufacturer claims, these are chemical compounds rather than ""natural"" or harmless products. These drugs can produce a ""high"" similar to marijuana and have become a popular but dangerous alternative. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include:  A sense of euphoria or feeling ""high"" Elevated mood An altered sense of visual, auditory and taste perception Extreme anxiety or agitation Paranoia Hallucinations Increased heart rate and blood pressure or heart attack Vomiting Confusion Violent behavior  Substituted cathinones, also called ""bath salts,"" are mind-altering (psychoactive) substances similar to amphetamines such as ecstasy (MDMA) and cocaine. Packages are often labeled as other products to avoid detection. Despite the name, these are not bath products such as Epsom salts. Substituted cathinones can be eaten, snorted, inhaled or injected and are highly addictive. These drugs can cause severe intoxication, which results in dangerous health effects or even death. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include:  Feeling ""high"" Increased sociability Increased energy and agitation Increased sex drive Increased heart rate and blood pressure Problems thinking clearly Loss of muscle control Paranoia Panic attacks Hallucinations Delirium Psychotic and violent behavior  Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics Barbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics are prescription central nervous system depressants. They're often used and misused in search for a sense of relaxation or a desire to ""switch off"" or forget stress-related thoughts or feelings.  Barbiturates. An example is phenobarbital. Benzodiazepines. Examples include sedatives, such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan), clonazepam (Klonopin) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium). Hypnotics. Examples include prescription sleeping medicines such as zolpidem (Ambien) and zaleplon (Sonata).  Signs and symptoms of recent use can include:  Drowsiness Slurred speech Lack of coordination Irritability or changes in mood Problems concentrating or thinking clearly Memory problems Involuntary eye movements Lack of inhibition Slowed breathing and reduced blood pressure Falls or accidents Dizziness  Meth, cocaine and other stimulants Stimulants include amphetamines, meth (methamphetamine), cocaine, methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, others) and amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall XR, Mydayis). They're often used and misused in search of a ""high,"" or to boost energy, to improve performance at work or school, or to lose weight or control appetite. Signs and symptoms of recent use can include:  Feeling of happy excitement and too much confidence Increased alertness Increased energy and restlessness Behavior changes or aggression Rapid or rambling speech Larger than usual pupils, the black circles in the middle of the eyes Confusion, delusions and hallucinations Irritability, anxiety or paranoia Changes in heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature Nausea or vomiting with weight loss Poor judgment Nasal congestion and damage to the mucous membrane of the nose (if snorting drugs) Mouth sores, gum disease and tooth decay from smoking drugs (""meth mouth"") Insomnia Depression as the drug wears off  Club drugs Club drugs are commonly used at clubs, concerts and parties. Examples include methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also called MDMA, ecstasy or molly, and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, known as GHB. Other examples include ketamine and flunitrazepam or Rohypnol ― a brand used outside the U.S. ― also called roofie. These drugs are not all in the same category, but they share some similar effects and dangers, including long-term harmful effects. Because GHB and flunitrazepam can cause sedation, muscle relaxation, confusion and memory loss, the potential for sexual misconduct or sexual assault is associated with the use of these drugs. GHB Signs and symptoms of use of club drugs can include:  Hallucinations Paranoia Larger than usual pupils Chills and sweating Involuntary shaking (tremors) Behavior changes Muscle cramping and teeth clenching Muscle relaxation, poor coordination or problems moving Reduced inhibitions Heightened or altered sense of sight, sound and taste Poor judgment Memory problems or loss of memory Reduced consciousness Increased or decreased heart rate and blood pressure  Hallucinogens Use of hallucinogens can produce different signs and symptoms, depending on the drug. The most common hallucinogens are lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and phencyclidine (PCP). LSD use may cause: LSD  Hallucinations Greatly reduced perception of reality, for example, interpreting input from one of your senses as another, such as hearing colors Impulsive behavior Rapid shifts in emotions Permanent mental changes in perception Rapid heart rate and high blood pressure Tremors Flashbacks, a reexperience of the hallucinations — even years later  PCP use may cause: PCP  A feeling of being separated from your body and surroundings Hallucinations Problems with coordination and movement Aggressive, possibly violent behavior Involuntary eye movements Lack of pain sensation Increase in blood pressure and heart rate Problems with thinking and memory Problems speaking Poor judgment Intolerance to loud noise Sometimes seizures or coma  Inhalants Signs and symptoms of inhalant use vary, depending on the substance. Some commonly inhaled substances include glue, paint thinners, correction fluid, felt tip marker fluid, gasoline, cleaning fluids and household aerosol products. Due to the toxic nature of these substances, users may develop brain damage or sudden death. Signs and symptoms of use can include:  Possessing an inhalant substance without a reasonable explanation Brief happy excitement Behaving as if drunk Reduced ability to keep impulses under control Aggressive behavior or eagerness to fight Dizziness Nausea or vomiting Involuntary eye movements Appearing under the influence of drugs, with slurred speech, slow movements and poor coordination Irregular heartbeats Tremors Lingering odor of inhalant material Rash around the nose and mouth  Opioid painkillers Opioids are narcotic, painkilling drugs produced from opium or made synthetically. This class of drugs includes, among others, heroin, morphine, codeine, methadone, fentanyl and oxycodone. Sometimes called the ""opioid epidemic,"" addiction to opioid prescription pain medicines has reached an alarming rate across the United States. Some people who've been using opioids over a long period of time may need physician-prescribed temporary or long-term drug substitution during treatment. Signs and symptoms of narcotic use and dependence can include:  A sense of feeling ""high"" Reduced sense of pain Agitation, drowsiness or sedation Slurred speech Problems with attention and memory Pupils that are smaller than usual Lack of awareness or inattention to surrounding people and things Problems with coordination Depression Confusion Constipation Runny nose or nose sores (if snorting

It can occur within seconds to minutes after exposure to something you're allergic to ⸺ and worsens quickly. An anaphylactic reaction to shellfish is a medical emergency. Anaphylaxis requires immediate treatment with an epinephrine (adrenaline) injection and a follow-up trip to the emergency room. If anaphylaxis isn't treated right away, it can be fatal. Anaphylaxis causes the immune system to release a flood of chemicals that can cause you to go into shock. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include:  A swollen throat or tongue or a tightness in the throat (airway constriction) that makes it difficult for you to breathe Coughing, choking or wheezing with trouble breathing Shock, with a severe drop in your blood pressure and a rapid or weak pulse Severe skin rash, hives, itching or swelling Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Dizziness, lightheadedness or fainting ",901.0,"['shellfish allergy symptoms generally start minutes hour eating contact shellfish', ' may include:  hives itchy', ' irritated skin nasal stuffiness (congestion) swelling lips', ' face', ' tongue throat', ' parts body wheezing trouble breathing coughing choking tight feeling throat belly (abdominal) pain', ' diarrhea', ' nausea vomiting dizziness', ' lightheadedness fainting  anaphylaxis allergies can cause severe', ' potentially life-threatening allergic reaction known anaphylaxis', "" can occur seconds minutes exposure you're allergic ⸺ worsens quickly"", ' anaphylactic reaction shellfish medical emergency', ' anaphylaxis requires treatment epinephrine (adrenaline) injection follow-up trip emergency room', "" anaphylaxis isn't treated right away"", ' can fatal', ' anaphylaxis causes immune system release flood chemicals can cause shock', ' signs symptoms anaphylaxis include:  swollen throat tongue tightness throat (airway constriction) makes difficult breathe coughing', ' choking wheezing trouble breathing shock', ' severe drop blood pressure rapid weak pulse severe skin rash', ' hives', ' itching swelling nausea', ' vomiting diarrhea dizziness', ' lightheadedness fainting ']",['shellfish allergy']

"Factitious disorder symptoms involve mimicking or producing illness or injury or exaggerating symptoms or impairment to deceive others. People with the disorder go to great lengths to hide their deception, so it may be difficult to realize that their symptoms are actually part of a serious mental health disorder. They continue with the deception, even without receiving any visible benefit or reward or when faced with objective evidence that doesn't support their claims. Factitious disorder signs and symptoms may include: Clever and convincing medical or psychological problems  Extensive knowledge of medical terms and diseases Vague or inconsistent symptoms Conditions that get worse for no apparent reason Conditions that don't respond as expected to standard therapies Seeking treatment from many different doctors or hospitals, which may include using a fake name Reluctance to allow doctors to talk to family or friends or to other health care professionals Frequent stays in the hospital Eagerness to have frequent testing or risky operations Many surgical scars or evidence of numerous procedures Having few visitors when hospitalized Arguing with doctors and staff  Factious disorder imposed on another Factitious disorder imposed on another (previously called Munchausen syndrome by proxy) is when someone falsely claims that another person has physical or psychological signs or symptoms of illness, or causes injury or disease in another person with the intention of deceiving others. People with this disorder present another person as sick, injured or having problems functioning, claiming that medical attention is needed. Usually this involves a parent harming a child. This form of abuse can put a child in serious danger of injury or unnecessary medical care. How those with factitious disorder fake illness Because people with factitious disorder become experts at faking symptoms and diseases or inflicting real injuries upon themselves, it may be hard for health care professionals and loved ones to know if illnesses are real or not. People with factitious disorder make up symptoms or cause illnesses in several ways, such as:  Exaggerating existing symptoms. Even when an actual medical or psychological condition exists, they may exaggerate symptoms to appear sicker or more impaired than is true. Making up histories. They may give loved ones, health care professionals or support groups a false medical history, such as claiming to have had cancer or AIDS. Or they may falsify medical records to indicate an illness. Faking symptoms. They may fake symptoms, such as stomach pain, seizures or passing out. Causing self-harm. They may make themselves sick, for example, by injecting themselves with bacteria, milk, gasoline or feces. They may injure, cut or burn themselves. They may take medications, such as blood thinners or drugs for diabetes, to mimic diseases. They may also interfere with wound healing, such as reopening or infecting cuts. Tampering. They may manipulate medical instruments to skew results, such as heating up thermometers. Or they may tamper with lab tests, such as contaminating their urine samples with blood or other substances.

"There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life.  Bipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis). Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode. Cyclothymic disorder. You've had at least two years — or one year in children and teenagers — of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression). Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke.  Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment. Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization. Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms:  Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired Increased activity, energy or agitation Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria) Decreased need for sleep Unusual talkativeness Racing thoughts Distractibility Poor decision-making — for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments  Major depressive episode A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms:  Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability) Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all — or almost all — activities Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression) Either insomnia or sleeping too much Either restlessness or slowed behavior Fatigue or loss of energy Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide  Other features of bipolar disorder Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons. Symptoms in children and teens Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It's often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes.

"Vaginal agenesis often goes unnoticed until females reach their teens, but don't menstruate (amenorrhea). Other signs of puberty usually follow typical female development. Vaginal agenesis may have these features:  The genitals look like a typical female. The vagina may be shortened without a cervix at the end, or absent and marked only by a slight indentation where a vaginal opening would typically be located. There may be no uterus or one that's only partially developed. If there's tissue lining the uterus (endometrium), monthly cramping or chronic abdominal pain may occur. The ovaries typically are fully developed and functional, but they may be in an unusual location in the abdomen. Sometimes the pair of tubes that eggs travel through to get from the ovaries to the uterus (fallopian tubes) are absent or do not develop typically.

"The symptoms of narcolepsy may get worse during the first few years of the disorder. Then they continue for life. They include:   Excessive daytime sleepiness. People with narcolepsy fall asleep without warning. It can happen anywhere and at any time. It may happen when you're bored or during a task. For example, you may be working or talking with friends and suddenly fall asleep. It can be especially dangerous if you fall asleep while driving. You might fall asleep for only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, you'll often feel refreshed but you'll get sleepy again. You also may experience a decrease in how alert and focused you feel during the day. Daytime sleepiness often is the first symptom to appear. Feeling sleepy makes it hard to focus and function. Some people with narcolepsy continue doing a task when they fall asleep briefly. For example, you may fall asleep while writing, typing or driving. You might continue to perform that task while asleep. When you awaken, you can't remember what you did, and you probably didn't do it well.   Sudden loss of muscle tone. This condition is called cataplexy. It can cause slurred speech or complete weakness of most muscles. Symptoms may last up to a few minutes. Cataplexy can't be controlled. It's triggered by intense emotions. Often the emotions that cause cataplexy are positive. Laughter or excitement may cause the symptoms. But sometimes fear, surprise or anger can cause the loss of muscle tone. For example, when you laugh, your head may drop without your control. Or your knees may suddenly lose strength, causing you to fall. Some people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year. Others have several episodes a day. Not everyone with narcolepsy has these symptoms.   Sleep paralysis. People with narcolepsy often experience sleep paralysis. During sleep paralysis, you can't move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking. It's usually brief — lasting a few seconds or minutes. But it can be scary. You may be aware of it happening and can recall it afterward. Not everyone with sleep paralysis has narcolepsy.  Hallucinations. Sometimes people see things that aren't there during sleep paralysis. Hallucinations also may happen in bed without sleep paralysis. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep. They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, you might feel as if there is a stranger in your bedroom. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming. Changes in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep is when most dreaming happens. Typically, people enter REM sleep 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly to REM sleep. They tend to enter REM sleep within 15 minutes of falling asleep. REM sleep also can happen at any time of the day.  Other characteristics People with narcolepsy may have other sleep disorders. They might have obstructive sleep apnea, in which breathing starts and stops during the night. Or they may act out their dreams, known as REM sleep behavior disorder.

"Valley fever is the initial form of coccidioidomycosis infection. This initial, acute illness can develop into a more serious disease, including chronic and disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Acute coccidioidomycosis (valley fever) The initial, or acute, form of coccidioidomycosis is often mild, with few or no symptoms. Signs and symptoms occur one to three weeks after exposure. They tend to be similar to flu symptoms. Symptoms can range from minor to severe, including:  Fever Cough Tiredness Shortness of breath Headache Chills Night sweats Joint aches and muscle soreness Red, spotty rash, mainly on lower legs but sometimes on the chest, arms and back  If you don't become ill or have symptoms from valley fever, you may only find out you've been infected later. You may find out when you have a positive skin or blood test or when small areas of residual infection in the lungs (nodules) show up on a routine chest X-ray. The nodules typically don't cause problems, but they can look like cancer on X-rays. If you develop symptoms, especially severe ones, the course of the disease is highly variable. It can take months to fully recover. Fatigue and joint aches can last even longer. The disease's severity depends on several factors, including your overall health and the number of fungus spores you inhale. Chronic coccidioidomycosis If the initial coccidioidomycosis infection doesn't completely resolve, it may progress to a chronic form of pneumonia. This complication is most common in people with weakened immune systems. Signs and symptoms include:  Low-grade fever Weight loss Cough Chest pain Blood-tinged sputum (matter discharged during coughing) Nodules in the lungs  Disseminated coccidioidomycosis The most serious form of the disease, disseminated coccidioidomycosis, is uncommon. It occurs when the infection spreads (disseminates) beyond the lungs to other parts of the body. Most often these parts include the skin, bones, liver, brain, heart, and the membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord (meninges).

"Signs and symptoms of sarcoma include:  A lump that can be felt through the skin that may or may not be painful Bone pain A broken bone that happens unexpectedly, such as with a minor injury or no injury at all Abdominal pain Weight loss  Causes It's not clear what causes most sarcomas. In general, cancer forms when changes (mutations) happen in the DNA within cells. The DNA inside a cell is packaged into a large number of individual genes, each of which contains a set of instructions telling the cell what functions to perform, as well as how to grow and divide. Mutations might tell cells to grow and divide uncontrollably and to continue living when normal cells would die. If this happens, the accumulating abnormal cells can form a tumor. Cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of sarcoma include:  Inherited syndromes. Some syndromes that increase the risk of cancer can be passed from parents to children. Examples of syndromes that increase the risk of sarcoma include familial retinoblastoma and neurofibromatosis type 1. Radiation therapy for cancer. Radiation treatment for cancer increases the risk of developing a sarcoma later. Chronic swelling (lymphedema). Lymphedema is swelling caused by a backup of lymph fluid that occurs when the lymphatic system is blocked or damaged. It increases the risk of a type of sarcoma called angiosarcoma. Exposure to chemicals. Certain chemicals, such as some industrial chemicals and herbicides, can increase the risk of sarcoma that affects the liver. Exposure to viruses. The virus called human herpesvirus 8 can increase the risk of a type of sarcoma called Kaposi's sarcoma in people with weakened immune systems.

"Symptoms of pyloric stenosis usually appear within 3 to 5 weeks after birth. Pyloric stenosis is rare in babies older than 3 months. Symptoms include:  Vomiting after feeding. The baby may vomit forcefully, ejecting breast milk or formula up to several feet away. This is known as projectile vomiting. Vomiting might be mild at first. But over time, it becomes more severe as the pylorus opening narrows. The vomit may sometimes contain blood. Persistent hunger. Babies who have pyloric stenosis often want to eat soon after vomiting. Stomach contractions. You may notice wavelike contractions that ripple across your baby's upper stomach area soon after feeding but before vomiting. These contractions are part of the digestive process known as peristalsis. The contractions are caused by stomach muscles trying to force food through the narrowed pylorus. Dehydration. Your baby might cry without tears or become lethargic. You might find yourself changing fewer wet diapers or diapers that aren't as wet as you expect. Changes in bowel movements. Since pyloric stenosis prevents food from reaching the intestines, babies with this condition might be constipated. Weight problems. Pyloric stenosis can keep a baby from gaining weight, and sometimes can cause weight loss.

Staph infection MRSA infections start out as small red bumps that can quickly turn into deep, painful abscesses. MRSA infections start out as small red bumps that can quickly turn into deep, painful abscesses. MRSA Staph infections can range from minor skin problems to life-threatening illness. For example, endocarditis, a serious infection of the inner lining of your heart (endocardium) can be caused by staph bacteria. Signs and symptoms of staph infections vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the infection. Skin infections Skin infections caused by staph bacteria include:  Boils. The most common type of staph infection is the boil. This is a pocket of pus that develops in a hair follicle or oil gland. The skin over the infected area usually becomes red and swollen. If a boil breaks open, it will probably drain pus. Boils occur most often under the arms or around the groin or buttocks. Impetigo. This contagious, often painful rash can be caused by staph bacteria. Impetigo usually has large blisters that may ooze fluid and develop a honey-colored crust. Cellulitis. Cellulitis is an infection of the deeper layers of skin. It causes redness and swelling on the surface of your skin. Sores or areas of oozing discharge may develop, too. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Toxins produced by the staph bacteria may cause staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Affecting mostly babies and children, this condition includes a fever, a rash and sometimes blisters. When the blisters break, the top layer of skin comes off. This leaves a red, raw surface that looks like a burn.  Food poisoning Staph bacteria are one of the most common causes of food poisoning. The bacteria multiply in food and produce toxins that make you sick. Symptoms come on quickly, usually within hours of eating a contaminated food. Symptoms usually disappear quickly, too, often lasting just half a day. A staph infection in food usually doesn't cause a fever. Signs and symptoms you can expect with this type of staph infection include:  Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Dehydration Low blood pressure  Bacteremia Also known as a bloodstream infection, bacteremia occurs when staph bacteria enter the bloodstream. A fever and low blood pressure are signs of bacteremia. The bacteria can travel to locations deep within your body to cause infections that affect:  Internal organs, such as your brain (meningitis), heart (endocarditis) or lungs (pneumonia) Bones and muscles Surgically implanted devices, such as artificial joints or cardiac pacemakers  Toxic shock syndrome This life-threatening condition results from toxins produced by some strains of staph bacteria. The condition has been linked to certain types of tampons, skin wounds and surgery. It usually develops suddenly with:  A high fever Nausea and vomiting A rash on your palms and soles that looks like a sunburn Confusion Muscle aches Diarrhea Stomach pain  Septic arthritis Septic arthritis is often caused by a staph infection. The bacteria often target the knees, shoulders, hips, and fingers or toes. Artificial joints may also be at risk of infection. Signs and symptoms may include:  Joint swelling Severe pain in the affected joint Fever ",939.0,"['           staph infection       open pop-up dialog box          close    staph infection   staph infection mrsa infections start small red bumps can quickly turn deep', ' painful abscesses', '               staph infection       open pop-up dialog box           staph infection       open pop-up dialog box  open pop-up dialog box       close    staph infection   staph infection mrsa infections start small red bumps can quickly turn deep', ' painful abscesses', '          close    staph infection   staph infection mrsa infections start small red bumps can quickly turn deep', ' painful abscesses', '        close    staph infection   staph infection mrsa infections start small red bumps can quickly turn deep', ' painful abscesses', '     close    close  close staph infection   staph infection mrsa infections start small red bumps can quickly turn deep', ' painful abscesses', '  staph infection mrsa infections start small red bumps can quickly turn deep', ' painful abscesses', ' mrsa infections start small red bumps can quickly turn deep', ' painful abscesses', ' mrsa staph infections can range minor skin problems life-threatening illness', ' example', ' endocarditis', ' infection inner lining heart (endocardium) can caused staph bacteria', ' signs symptoms staph infections vary widely', ' depending location severity infection', ' skin infections skin infections caused staph bacteria include:  boils', ' common type staph infection boil', ' pocket pus develops hair follicle oil gland', ' skin infected area red swollen', ' boil breaks open', ' will drain pus', ' boils occur arms groin buttocks', ' impetigo', ' contagious', ' painful rash can caused staph bacteria', ' impetigo large blisters may ooze fluid develop honey-colored crust', ' cellulitis', ' cellulitis infection deeper layers skin', ' causes redness swelling surface skin', ' sores areas oozing discharge may develop', ' too', ' staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome', ' toxins produced staph bacteria may cause staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome', ' affecting babies children', ' condition includes fever', ' rash blisters', ' blisters break', ' top layer skin comes off', ' leaves red', ' raw surface looks like burn', '  food poisoning staph bacteria common causes food poisoning', ' bacteria multiply food produce toxins sick', ' symptoms come quickly', ' hours eating contaminated food', ' symptoms disappear quickly', ' too', ' lasting just half day', "" staph infection food doesn't cause fever"", ' signs symptoms can expect type staph infection include:  nausea vomiting diarrhea dehydration low blood pressure  bacteremia known bloodstream infection', ' bacteremia occurs staph bacteria enter bloodstream', ' fever low blood pressure signs bacteremia', ' bacteria can travel locations deep body cause infections affect:  internal organs', ' brain (meningitis)', ' heart (endocarditis) lungs (pneumonia) bones muscles surgically implanted devices', ' artificial joints cardiac pacemakers  toxic shock syndrome life-threatening condition results toxins produced strains staph bacteria', ' condition linked types tampons', ' skin wounds surgery', ' develops suddenly with:  high fever nausea vomiting rash palms soles looks like sunburn confusion muscle aches diarrhea stomach pain  septic arthritis septic arthritis caused staph infection', ' bacteria target knees', ' shoulders', ' hips', ' fingers toes', ' artificial joints may risk infection', ' signs symptoms may include:  joint swelling severe pain affected joint fever ']",['staph infections']

"Typical agoraphobia symptoms include fear of:  Leaving home alone. Crowds or waiting in line. Enclosed spaces, such as movie theaters, elevators or small stores. Open spaces, such as parking lots, bridges or malls. Using public transportation, such as a bus, plane or train.  These situations cause anxiety because you fear you won't be able to escape or find help if you start to feel panicked. Or you may fear having other disabling or embarrassing symptoms, such as dizziness, fainting, falling or diarrhea. In addition:  Your fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger of the situation. You avoid the situation, you need a companion to go with you, or you endure the situation but are extremely upset. You have major distress or problems with social situations, work or other areas in your life because of the fear, anxiety or avoidance. Your fear and avoidance usually lasts six months or longer.  Panic disorder and agoraphobia Some people have panic disorder in addition to agoraphobia. Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder that includes panic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden feeling of extreme fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes and triggers a variety of intense physical symptoms. You might think that you're totally losing control, having a heart attack or even dying. Fear of another panic attack can lead to avoiding similar situations or the place where it happened in an attempt to prevent future panic attacks. Symptoms of a panic attack can include:  Rapid heart rate. Trouble breathing or a feeling of choking. Chest pain or pressure. Lightheadedness or dizziness. Feeling shaky, numb or tingling. Sweating too much. Sudden flushing or chills. Upset stomach or diarrhea. Feeling a loss of control. Fear of dying.

Encephalitis may cause many different symptoms including confusion, personality changes, seizures or problems with movement. Encephalitis also may cause changes in sight or hearing. Most people with infectious encephalitis have flu-like symptoms, such as:  Headache. Fever. Aches in muscles or joints. Fatigue or weakness.  Typically, these are followed by more-severe symptoms over a period of hours to days, such as:  Stiff neck. Confusion, agitation or hallucinations. Seizures. Loss of sensation or being unable to move certain areas of the face or body. Irregular movements. Muscle weakness. Problems with speech or hearing. Loss of consciousness, including coma.  In infants and young children, signs and symptoms also might include:  Bulging in the soft spots of an infant's skull, known as fontanels. Nausea and vomiting. Stiffness affecting the whole body. Poor feeding or not waking for a feeding. Irritability.  In cases of autoimmune encephalitis, symptoms may develop more slowly over several weeks. Flu-like symptoms are less common, but can sometimes happen weeks before more-severe symptoms start. Symptoms are different for everyone, but it's common for people to have a combination of symptoms including:  Changes in personality. Memory loss. Problems understanding what is real and what is not, known as psychosis. Seeing or hearing things that aren't there. These are called hallucinations. Seizures. Changes in vision. Sleep problems.

Symptoms may occur suddenly and get worse quickly, though in some cases, they develop gradually. They may affect one or both eyes. Occasionally, there are no symptoms, and signs of uveitis are observed on a routine eye exam. The uvea is the middle layer of tissue in the wall of the eye. It consists of the iris, the ciliary body and the choroid. When you look at your eye in the mirror, you will see the white part of the eye (sclera) and the colored part of the eye (iris). The iris is located inside the front of the eye. The ciliary body is a structure behind the iris. The choroid is a layer of blood vessels between the retina and the sclera. The retina lines the inside of the back of the eye, like wallpaper. The inside of the back of the eye is filled with a gel-like liquid called vitreous. The type of uveitis you have depends on which part or parts of the eye are inflamed:  Anterior uveitis affects the inside of the front of your eye (between the cornea and the iris) and the ciliary body. It is also called iritis and is the most common type of uveitis. Intermediate uveitis affects the retina and blood vessels just behind the lens (pars plana) as well as the gel in the center of the eye (vitreous). Posterior uveitis affects a layer on the inside of the back of your eye, either the retina or the choroid. Panuveitis occurs when all layers of the uvea are inflamed, from the front to the back of your eye.  When to seek medical advice Contact your doctor if you think you have the warning signs of uveitis. He or she may refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist).

"Bee stings can produce different reactions, ranging from temporary pain and discomfort to a severe allergic reaction. Having one type of reaction doesn't mean you'll always have the same reaction every time you're stung or that the next reaction will necessarily be more severe. Mild reaction Most of the time, bee sting symptoms are minor and include:  Instant, sharp burning pain at the sting site A red welt at the sting area Slight swelling around the sting area  In most people, the swelling and pain go away within a few hours. Moderate reaction Some people who get stung by a bee or other insect have a bit stronger reaction, with signs and symptoms such as:  Extreme redness Swelling at the site of the sting that gradually enlarges over the next day or two  Moderate reactions tend to resolve over five to 10 days. Having a moderate reaction doesn't mean you'll have a severe allergic reaction the next time you're stung. But some people develop similar moderate reactions each time they're stung. If this happens to you, talk to your doctor about treatment and prevention, especially if the reaction becomes more severe each time. Severe allergic reaction A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to bee stings is potentially life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. A small percentage of people who are stung by a bee or other insect quickly develop anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include:  Skin reactions, including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin Difficulty breathing Swelling of the throat and tongue A weak, rapid pulse Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea Dizziness or fainting Loss of consciousness  People who have a severe allergic reaction to a bee sting have a 25% to 65% chance of anaphylaxis the next time they're stung. Talk to your doctor or an allergy specialist about prevention measures such as immunotherapy (""allergy shots"") to avoid a similar reaction in case you get stung again. Multiple bee stings Generally, insects such as bees and wasps aren't aggressive and only sting in self-defense. In most cases, this results in one or perhaps a few stings. In some cases a person will disrupt a hive or swarm of bees and get multiple stings. Some types of bees — such as Africanized honeybees — are more likely than are other bees to swarm, stinging in a group. If you get stung more than a dozen times, the accumulation of venom may induce a toxic reaction and make you feel quite sick.

"Signs and symptoms of trichotillomania often include:  Repeatedly pulling your hair out, typically from your scalp, eyebrows or eyelashes, but sometimes from other body areas, and sites may vary over time An increasing sense of tension before pulling, or when you try to resist pulling A sense of pleasure or relief after the hair is pulled Noticeable hair loss, such as shortened hair or thinned or bald areas on the scalp or other areas of your body, including sparse or missing eyelashes or eyebrows Preference for specific types of hair, rituals that accompany hair pulling or patterns of hair pulling Biting, chewing or eating pulled-out hair Playing with pulled-out hair or rubbing it across your lips or face Repeatedly trying to stop pulling out your hair or trying to do it less often without success Significant distress or problems at work, school or in social situations related to pulling out your hair  Many people who have trichotillomania also pick their skin, bite their nails or chew their lips. Sometimes pulling hairs from pets or dolls or from materials, such as clothes or blankets, may be a sign. Most people with trichotillomania pull hair in private and generally try to hide the disorder from others. For people with trichotillomania, hair pulling can be:  Focused. Some people pull their hair intentionally to relieve tension or distress — for example, pulling hair out to get relief from the overwhelming urge to pull hair. Some people may develop elaborate rituals for pulling hair, such as finding just the right hair or biting pulled hairs. Automatic. Some people pull their hair without even realizing they're doing it, such as when they're bored, reading or watching TV.  The same person may do both focused and automatic hair pulling, depending on the situation and mood. Certain positions or rituals may trigger hair pulling, such as resting your head on your hand or brushing your hair. Trichotillomania can be related to emotions:  Negative emotions. For many people with trichotillomania, hair pulling is a way of dealing with negative or uncomfortable feelings, such as stress, anxiety, tension, boredom, loneliness, fatigue or frustration. Positive feelings. People with trichotillomania often find that pulling out hair feels satisfying and provides a measure of relief. As a result, they continue to pull their hair to maintain these positive feelings.  Trichotillomania is a long-term (chronic) disorder. Without treatment, symptoms can vary in severity over time. For example, the hormonal changes of menstruation can worsen symptoms in women. For some people, if not treated, symptoms can come and go for weeks, months or years at a time. Rarely, hair pulling ends within a few years of starting. When to see a doctor If you can't stop pulling out your hair or you feel embarrassed or ashamed by your appearance as a result of your hair pulling, talk to your doctor.

"The primary sign of pseudobulbar affect (PBA) is frequent, involuntary and uncontrollable outbursts of crying or laughing that are exaggerated or not connected to your emotional state. Laughter often turns to tears. Your mood will appear normal between episodes, which can occur at any time. Crying appears to be a more common sign of PBA than laughing. The degree of the emotional response caused by PBA is often striking, with crying or laughing lasting up to several minutes. For example, you might laugh uncontrollably in response to a mildly amusing comment. Or you might laugh or cry in situations that others don't see as funny or sad. These emotional responses typically represent a change from how you would have previously responded. Because pseudobulbar affect often involves crying, the condition is frequently mistaken for depression. However, PBA episodes tend to be short in duration, while depression causes a persistent feeling of sadness. Also, people with PBA often lack certain features of depression, such as sleep disturbances or a loss of appetite. But depression is common among those who have pseudobulbar affect. When to see a doctor If you think you have PBA, talk to your doctor. If you have a neurological condition, you might already be treated by a doctor who can diagnose PBA. Helpful specialists include neuropsychologists, neurologists and psychiatrists. It's suspected that many cases of pseudobulbar affect go unreported and undiagnosed due to a lack of awareness about the condition.",817.0,"['primary sign pseudobulbar affect (pba) frequent', ' involuntary uncontrollable outbursts crying laughing exaggerated connected emotional state', ' laughter turns tears', ' mood will normal episodes', ' can occur time', ' crying common sign pba laughing', ' degree emotional response caused pba striking', ' crying laughing lasting minutes', ' example', ' laugh uncontrollably response mildly amusing comment', "" laugh cry situations don't see funny sad"", ' emotional responses typically represent change previously responded', ' pseudobulbar affect involves crying', ' condition frequently mistaken depression', ' however', ' pba episodes tend short duration', ' depression causes persistent feeling sadness', ' also', ' people pba lack features depression', ' sleep disturbances loss appetite', ' depression common who pseudobulbar affect', ' see doctor think pba', ' talk doctor', ' neurological condition', ' treated doctor who can diagnose pba', ' helpful specialists include neuropsychologists', ' neurologists psychiatrists', "" it's suspected cases pseudobulbar affect unreported undiagnosed due lack awareness condition"", '']",['pseudobulbar affect']
"A specific phobia involves an intense, persistent fear of a specific object or situation that's out of proportion to the actual risk. There are many types of phobias, and it's not unusual to experience a specific phobia about more than one object or situation. Specific phobias can also occur along with other types of anxiety disorders.   Common categories of specific phobias are a fear of:  Situations, such as airplanes, enclosed spaces or going to school Nature, such as thunderstorms or heights Animals or insects, such as dogs or spiders Blood, injection or injury, such as needles, accidents or medical procedures Others, such as choking, vomiting, loud noises or clowns  Each specific phobia is referred to by its own term. Examples of more common terms include acrophobia for the fear of heights and claustrophobia for the fear of confined spaces. No matter what specific phobia you have, it's likely to produce these types of reactions:  An immediate feeling of intense fear, anxiety and panic when exposed to or even thinking about the source of your fear Awareness that your fears are unreasonable or exaggerated but feeling powerless to control them Worsening anxiety as the situation or object gets closer to you in time or physical proximity Doing everything possible to avoid the object or situation or enduring it with intense anxiety or fear Difficulty functioning normally because of your fear Physical reactions and sensations, including sweating, rapid heartbeat, tight chest or difficulty breathing Feeling nauseated, dizzy or fainting around blood or injuries In children, possibly tantrums, clinging, crying, or refusing to leave a parent's side or approach their fear  When to see a doctor When to see a doctor An unreasonable fear can be an annoyance — having to take the stairs instead of an elevator or driving the long way to work instead of taking the freeway, for instance — but it isn't considered a specific phobia unless it seriously disrupts your life. If anxiety negatively affects functioning in work, school or social situations, talk with your doctor or a mental health professional. Childhood fears, such as fear of the dark, of monsters or of being left alone, are common, and most children outgrow them. But if your child has a persistent, excessive fear that interferes with daily functioning at home or school, talk to your child's doctor. Most people can be helped with the right therapy.

"The muscle contractions involved in cervical dystonia can cause your head to twist in a variety of directions, including:  Chin toward shoulder Ear toward shoulder Chin straight up Chin straight down  The most common type of twisting associated with cervical dystonia is when your chin is pulled toward your shoulder. Some people experience a combination of abnormal head postures. A jerking motion of the head also may occur. Many people who have cervical dystonia also experience neck pain that can radiate into the shoulders. The disorder can also cause headaches. In some people, the pain from cervical dystonia can be exhausting and disabling. Causes In most people with cervical dystonia, the cause is unknown. Some people who have cervical dystonia have a family history of the disorder. Researchers have found gene mutations associated with cervical dystonia. Cervical dystonia is also sometimes linked to head, neck or shoulder injuries. Risk factors Risk factors for cervical dystonia include:  Age. While the disorder can occur in people of any age, it most commonly begins after age 30. Your sex. Women are more likely to develop cervical dystonia than are men. Family history. If a close family member has cervical dystonia or some other type of dystonia, you are at higher risk of developing the disorder.  Complications In some cases, the involuntary muscle contractions associated with cervical dystonia can spread to nearby areas of your body. The most common locations include the face, jaw, arms and trunk. People who have cervical dystonia may also develop bone spurs that may reduce the amount of space in the spinal canal. This can cause tingling, numbness and weakness in the arms, hands, legs or feet.

"Alcohol use disorder can be mild, moderate or severe, based on the number of symptoms you experience. Signs and symptoms may include:  Being unable to limit the amount of alcohol you drink Wanting to cut down on how much you drink or making unsuccessful attempts to do so Spending a lot of time drinking, getting alcohol or recovering from alcohol use Feeling a strong craving or urge to drink alcohol Failing to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home due to repeated alcohol use Continuing to drink alcohol even though you know it's causing physical, social, work or relationship problems Giving up or reducing social and work activities and hobbies to use alcohol Using alcohol in situations where it's not safe, such as when driving or swimming Developing a tolerance to alcohol so you need more to feel its effect or you have a reduced effect from the same amount Experiencing withdrawal symptoms — such as nausea, sweating and shaking — when you don't drink, or drinking to avoid these symptoms  Alcohol use disorder can include periods of being drunk (alcohol intoxication) and symptoms of withdrawal.  Alcohol intoxication results as the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream increases. The higher the blood alcohol concentration is, the more likely you are to have bad effects. Alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems and mental changes. These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, poor judgment, slurred speech, problems with attention or memory, and poor coordination. You can also have periods called ""blackouts,"" where you don't remember events. Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma, permanent brain damage or even death. Alcohol withdrawal can occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. It can occur within several hours to 4 to 5 days later. Signs and symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hand tremors, problems sleeping, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, restlessness and agitation, anxiety, and occasionally seizures. Symptoms can be severe enough to impair your ability to function at work or in social situations.  What is considered 1 drink? The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines one standard drink as any one of these:  12 ounces (355 milliliters) of regular beer (about 5% alcohol) 8 to 9 ounces (237 to 266 milliliters) of malt liquor (about 7% alcohol) 5 ounces (148 milliliters) of wine (about 12% alcohol) 1.5 ounces (44 milliliters) of hard liquor or distilled spirits (about 40% alcohol) ",32.0,"['alcohol disorder can mild', ' moderate severe', ' based number symptoms experience', ' signs symptoms may include:  being unable limit amount alcohol drink wanting cut down drink making unsuccessful attempts spending time drinking', ' alcohol recovering alcohol feeling strong craving urge drink alcohol fulfill major obligations work', "" school home due repeated alcohol continuing drink alcohol know it's causing physical"", ' social', "" work relationship problems giving reducing social work activities hobbies alcohol using alcohol situations it's safe"", ' driving swimming developing tolerance alcohol need feel effect reduced effect amount experiencing withdrawal symptoms — nausea', "" sweating shaking — don't drink"", ' drinking avoid symptoms  alcohol disorder can include periods being drunk (alcohol intoxication) symptoms withdrawal', '  alcohol intoxication results amount alcohol bloodstream increases', ' higher blood alcohol concentration is', ' likely bad effects', ' alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems mental changes', ' may include inappropriate behavior', ' unstable moods', ' poor judgment', ' slurred speech', ' problems attention memory', ' poor coordination', ' can periods called ""blackouts', '"" don\'t remember events', ' high blood alcohol levels can lead coma', ' permanent brain damage death', ' alcohol withdrawal can occur alcohol heavy prolonged greatly reduced', ' can occur hours 4 5 days later', ' signs symptoms include sweating', ' rapid heartbeat', ' hand tremors', ' problems sleeping', ' nausea vomiting', ' hallucinations', ' restlessness agitation', ' anxiety', ' occasionally seizures', ' symptoms can severe impair ability function work social situations', '  considered 1 drink? national institute alcohol abuse alcoholism defines standard drink these:  12 ounces (355 milliliters) regular beer (about 5% alcohol) 8 9 ounces (237 266 milliliters) malt liquor (about 7% alcohol) 5 ounces (148 milliliters) wine (about 12% alcohol) 1', '5 ounces (44 milliliters) hard liquor distilled spirits (about 40% alcohol) ']",['alcohol use disorder']

"The primary features of ADHD include inattention and hyperactive-impulsive behavior. ADHD symptoms start before age 12, and in some children, they're noticeable as early as 3 years of age. ADHD symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe, and they may continue into adulthood. ADHD ADHD ADHD ADHD occurs more often in males than in females, and behaviors can be different in boys and girls. For example, boys may be more hyperactive and girls may tend to be quietly inattentive. ADHD There are three subtypes of ADHD: ADHD  Predominantly inattentive. The majority of symptoms fall under inattention. Predominantly hyperactive/impulsive. The majority of symptoms are hyperactive and impulsive. Combined. This is a mix of inattentive symptoms and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms.  Inattention A child who shows a pattern of inattention may often:  Fail to pay close attention to details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork Have trouble staying focused in tasks or play Appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly Have difficulty following through on instructions and fail to finish schoolwork or chores Have trouble organizing tasks and activities Avoid or dislike tasks that require focused mental effort, such as homework Lose items needed for tasks or activities, for example, toys, school assignments, pencils Be easily distracted Forget to do some daily activities, such as forgetting to do chores  Hyperactivity and impulsivity A child who shows a pattern of hyperactive and impulsive symptoms may often:  Fidget with or tap his or her hands or feet, or squirm in the seat Have difficulty staying seated in the classroom or in other situations Be on the go, in constant motion Run around or climb in situations when it's not appropriate Have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly Talk too much Blurt out answers, interrupting the questioner Have difficulty waiting for his or her turn Interrupt or intrude on others' conversations, games or activities  Typical developmental behavior vs. ADHD Most healthy children are inattentive, hyperactive or impulsive at one time or another. It's typical for preschoolers to have short attention spans and be unable to stick with one activity for long. Even in older children and teenagers, attention span often depends on the level of interest. The same is true of hyperactivity. Young children are naturally energetic — they often are still full of energy long after they've worn their parents out. In addition, some children just naturally have a higher activity level than others do. Children should never be classified as having ADHD just because they're different from their friends or siblings. ADHD Children who have problems in school but get along well at home or with friends are likely struggling with something other than ADHD.

It may get darker or lighter with age. Vein malformations. These include swollen, twisted veins (varicose veins), usually on the surface of the legs. Deeper malformed veins in the arms, legs, abdomen and pelvis also can occur. There may be spongy tissue filled with small veins in or under the skin. Malformed veins may become more prominent with age. Overgrowth of bones and soft tissue. This begins in infancy and may be limited to one leg, but it can occur in an arm or, rarely, in the trunk or face. This overgrowth of bone and tissue creates a larger and longer extremity. Rarely, there may be fusion of fingers or toes or extra fingers or toes. Lymphatic system malformations. The lymphatic system — part of the immune system that protects against infection and disease and transports lymphatic fluid — can be malformed.

"The signs and symptoms of a brain tumor depend on the brain tumor's size and location. Symptoms also might depend on how fast the brain tumor is growing, which is also called the tumor grade. General signs and symptoms caused by brain tumors may include:  Headache or pressure in the head that is worse in the morning. Headaches that happen more often and seem more severe. Headaches that are sometimes described as tension headaches or migraines. Nausea or vomiting. Eye problems, such as blurry vision, seeing double or losing sight on the sides of your vision. Losing feeling or movement in an arm or a leg. Trouble with balance. Speech problems. Feeling very tired. Confusion in everyday matters. Memory problems. Having trouble following simple commands. Personality or behavior changes. Seizures, especially if there is no history of seizures. Hearing problems. Dizziness or a sense that the world is spinning, also called vertigo. Feeling very hungry and gaining weight.  Brain tumors that aren't cancerous tend to cause symptoms that develop slowly. Noncancerous brain tumors also are called benign brain tumors. They might cause subtle symptoms that you don't notice at first. The symptoms might get worse over months or years. Cancerous brain tumors cause symptoms that get worse quickly. Cancerous brain tumors also are called brain cancers or malignant brain tumors. They cause symptoms that come on suddenly. They get worse in a matter of days or weeks. Brain tumor headaches Headaches are the most common symptom of brain tumors. Headaches happen in about half of people with brain tumors. Headaches can happen if a growing brain tumor presses on healthy cells around it. Or a brain tumor can cause swelling in the brain that increases pressure in the head and leads to a headache. Headache pain caused by brain tumors is often worse when you wake up in the morning. But it can happen at any time. Some people have headaches that wake them from sleep. Brain tumor headaches tend to cause pain that's worse when coughing or straining. People with brain tumors most often report that the headache feels like a tension headache. Some people say the headache feels like a migraine. Brain tumors in the back of the head might cause a headache with neck pain. If the brain tumor happens in the front of the head, the headache might feel like eye pain or sinus pain.

Brain tumors in different parts of the cerebrum might cause different symptoms.  Brain tumors in the front of the brain. The frontal lobes are in the front of the brain. They control thinking and movement. Frontal lobe brain tumors might cause balance problems and trouble walking. There might be personality changes, such as forgetfulness and lack of interest in usual activities. Sometimes family members notice that the person with the brain tumor seems different. Brain tumors in the middle of the brain. The parietal lobes are in the upper middle part of the brain. They help process information about touch, taste, smell, vision and hearing. Parietal lobe brain tumors can cause problems related to the senses. Examples include vision problems and hearing problems. Brain tumors in the back of the brain. The occipital lobes are in the back of the brain. They control vision. Occipital lobe brain tumors can cause vision loss. Brain tumors in the lower part of the brain. The temporal lobes are on the sides of the brain. They process memories and senses. Temporal lobe brain tumors can cause memory problems.

"Signs and symptoms of respiratory syncytial virus infection most commonly appear about four to six days after exposure to the virus. In adults and older children, RSV usually causes mild cold-like signs and symptoms. These may include: RSV  Congested or runny nose Dry cough Low-grade fever Sore throat Sneezing Headache  In severe cases RSV infection can spread to the lower respiratory tract, causing pneumonia or bronchiolitis — inflammation of the small airway passages entering the lungs. Signs and symptoms may include: RSV  Fever Severe cough Wheezing — a high-pitched noise that's usually heard on breathing out (exhaling) Rapid breathing or difficulty breathing — the person may prefer to sit up rather than lie down Bluish color of the skin due to lack of oxygen (cyanosis)  Infants are most severely affected by RSV. Signs and symptoms of severe RSV infection in infants include: RSV RSV  Short, shallow and rapid breathing Struggling to breathe — chest muscles and skin pull inward with each breath Cough Poor feeding Unusual tiredness (lethargy) Irritability  Most children and adults recover in one to two weeks, although some might have repeated wheezing. Severe or life-threatening infection requiring a hospital stay may occur in premature infants or in anyone who has chronic heart or lung problems. RSV and COVID-19 Because RSV and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are both types of respiratory viruses, some symptoms of RSV and COVID-19 can be similar.

"A benign peripheral nerve tumor can cause symptoms if it presses on the nerve in which it is growing or on nearby nerves, blood vessels or tissues. As the tumor grows, it may be more likely to cause symptoms, but even small tumors can sometimes cause symptoms. Symptoms depend on the location of the tumor and which tissues it affects. Symptoms may include:  Swelling or a lump under your skin Pain, tingling or numbness Weakness or loss of function in the affected area Dizziness or loss of balance  Causes The cause of benign peripheral nerve tumors usually isn't known. Some are passed down in families. The most common type of benign peripheral nerve tumor is a schwannoma. A schwannoma typically starts in a single bundle inside the main nerve, shifting the rest of the nerve. Another common type is a neurofibroma. A neurofibroma also often forms inside the nerve. Sometimes it grows from several nerve bundles. Perineuriomas are rare and can grow from inside or outside the nerve. Tumors outside a nerve can cause problems when they press on the nerve. Other benign tumors that form outside nerves are soft lumps of slow-growing fat cells called lipomas and ganglion cysts.

"Signs and symptoms of sickle cell anemia usually appear around 6 months of age. They vary from person to person and may change over time. Signs and symptoms can include:  Anemia. Sickle cells break apart easily and die. Red blood cells usually live for about 120 days before they need to be replaced. But sickle cells typically die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Without enough red blood cells, the body can't get enough oxygen and this causes fatigue.  Episodes of pain. Periodic episodes of extreme pain, called pain crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to your chest, abdomen and joints. The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few days. Some people have only a few pain crises a year. Others have a dozen or more a year. A severe pain crisis requires a hospital stay. Some adolescents and adults with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain, which can result from bone and joint damage, ulcers, and other causes.  Swelling of hands and feet. The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking blood circulation in the hands and feet. Frequent infections. Sickle cells can damage the spleen, increasing vulnerability to infections. Infants and children with sickle cell anemia commonly receive vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia. Delayed growth or puberty. Red blood cells provide the body with the oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow growth in infants and children and delay puberty in teenagers. Vision problems. Tiny blood vessels that supply the eyes can become plugged with sickle cells.

"Signs and symptoms of systemic mastocytosis depend on the part of the body affected by excessive mast cells. Too many mast cells can build up in the skin, liver, spleen, bone marrow or intestines. Less commonly, other organs such as the brain, heart or lungs also may be affected. Signs and symptoms of systemic mastocytosis may include:  Flushing, itching or hives Abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting Anemia or bleeding disorders Bone and muscle pain Enlarged liver, spleen or lymph nodes Depression, mood changes or problems concentrating  The mast cells are triggered to produce substances that cause inflammation and symptoms. People have different triggers, but the most common ones include:  Alcohol Skin irritation Spicy foods Exercise Insect stings Certain medications  When to see a doctor When to see a doctor  Talk to your doctor if you have problems with flushing or hives, or if you have concerns about the signs or symptoms listed above. Causes Most cases of systemic mastocytosis are caused by a random change (mutation) in the KIT gene. Typically this flaw in the KIT gene is not inherited. Too many mast cells are produced and build up in tissues and body organs, releasing substances such as histamine, leukotrienes and cytokines that cause inflammation and symptoms. Complications Complications of systemic mastocytosis can include:  Anaphylactic reaction. This severe allergic reaction includes signs and symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, fainting, loss of consciousness and shock. If you have a severe allergic reaction, you may need an injection of epinephrine. Blood disorders. These can include anemia and poor blood clotting. Peptic ulcer disease. Chronic stomach irritation can lead to ulcers and bleeding in your digestive tract. Reduced bone density. Because systemic mastocytosis can affect your bones and bone marrow, you may be at risk of bone problems, such as osteoporosis. Organ failure. A buildup of mast cells in body organs can cause inflammation and damage to the organ.

"Heart disease symptoms depend on the type of heart disease. Symptoms of heart disease in the blood vessels Coronary artery disease is a common heart condition that affects the major blood vessels that supply the heart muscle. Cholesterol deposits (plaques) in the heart arteries are usually the cause of coronary artery disease. The buildup of these plaques is called atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis). Atherosclerosis reduces blood flow to the heart and other parts of the body. It can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Coronary artery disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to have chest pain. Women are more likely to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue. Symptoms of coronary artery disease can include:  Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina) Shortness of breath Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly area or back Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in the legs or arms if the blood vessels in those body areas are narrowed  You might not be diagnosed with coronary artery disease until you have a heart attack, angina, stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch for heart symptoms and discuss concerns with your health care provider. Heart (cardiovascular) disease can sometimes be found early with regular health checkups.

In this video, we'll cover the basics of coronary artery disease. What is it? Who gets it? The symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. Whether you're looking for answers for yourself or someone you love, we're here to give you the best information available. Coronary artery disease, also called CAD, is a condition that affects your heart. It is the most common heart disease in the United States. CAD happens when coronary arteries struggle to supply the heart with enough blood, oxygen and nutrients. Cholesterol deposits, or plaques, are almost always to blame. These buildups narrow your arteries, decreasing blood flow to your heart. This can cause chest pain, shortness of breath or even a heart attack. CAD typically takes a long time to develop. So often, patients don't know that they have it until there's a problem. But there are ways to prevent coronary artery disease, and ways to know if you're at risk and ways to treat it. Who gets it? Anyone can develop CAD. It begins when fats, cholesterols and other substances gather along the walls of your arteries. This process is called atherosclerosis. It's typically no cause for concern. However, too much buildup can lead to a blockage, obstructing blood flow. There are a number of risk factors, common red flags, that can contribute to this and ultimately lead to coronary artery disease. First, getting older can mean more damaged and narrowed arteries. Second, men are generally at a greater risk. But the risk for women increases after menopause. Existing health conditions matter, too. High blood pressure can thicken your arteries, narrowing your blood flow. High cholesterol levels can increase the rate of plaque buildup. Diabetes is also associated with higher risk, as is being overweight. Your lifestyle plays a large role as well. Physical inactivity, long periods of unrelieved stress in your life, an unhealthy diet and smoking can all increase your risk. And finally, family history. If a close relative was diagnosed at an early age with heart disease, you're at a greater risk. All these factors together can paint a picture of your risk for developing CAD. What are the symptoms? When coronary arteries become narrow, the heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. Remember, unlike most pumps, the heart has to pump its own energy supply. It's working harder with less. And you may begin to notice these signs and symptoms of pressure or tightness in your chest. This pain is called angina. It may feel like somebody is standing on your chest. When your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you might develop shortness of breath or extreme fatigue during activities. And if an artery becomes totally blocked, it leads to a heart attack. Classic signs and symptoms of a heart attack include crushing, substernal chest pain, pain in your shoulders or arms, shortness of breath, and sweating. However, many heart attacks have minimal or no symptoms and are found later during routine testing. How is it diagnosed? Diagnosing CAD starts by talking to your doctor. They'll be able to look at your medical history, do a physical exam and order routine blood work. Depending on that, they may suggest one or more of the following tests: an electrocardiogram or ECG, an echocardiogram or soundwave test of the heart, stress test, cardiac catheterization and angiogram, or a cardiac CT scan. How is it treated? Treating coronary artery disease usually means making changes to your lifestyle. This might be eating healthier foods, exercising regularly, losing excess weight, reducing stress or quitting smoking. The good news is these changes can do a lot to improve your outlook. Living a healthier life translates to having healthier arteries. When necessary, treatment could involve drugs like aspirin, cholesterol-modifying medications, beta-blockers, or certain medical procedures like angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery. What now? Discovering you have coronary artery disease can be overwhelming. But be encouraged. There are things you can do to manage and live with this condition. Reducing cholesterol, lowering blood pressure, quitting tobacco, eating healthier, exercising and managing your stress can make a world of difference. Better heart health starts by educating yourself. So don't be afraid to seek out information and ask your doctors about coronary artery disease.

Heart disease symptoms caused by irregular heartbeats (heart arrhythmias) The heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart arrhythmia symptoms can include:  Chest pain or discomfort Dizziness Fainting (syncope) or near fainting Fluttering in the chest Lightheadedness Racing heartbeat (tachycardia) Shortness of breath Slow heartbeat (bradycardia)  Heart disease symptoms caused by congenital heart defects Serious congenital heart defects usually are noticed soon after birth. Congenital heart defect symptoms in children could include:  Pale gray or blue skin or lips (cyanosis) Swelling in the legs, belly area or areas around the eyes In an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain  Less-serious congenital heart defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during adulthood. Symptoms of congenital heart defects that usually aren't immediately life-threatening include:  Easily getting short of breath during exercise or activity Easily tiring during exercise or activity Swelling of the hands, ankles or feet  Heart disease symptoms caused by diseased heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) Early stages of cardiomyopathy may not cause noticeable symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptoms may include:  Dizziness, lightheadedness and fainting Fatigue Feeling short of breath during activity or at rest Feeling short of breath at night when trying to sleep or waking up short of breath Irregular heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering Swollen legs, ankles or feet  Heart disease symptoms caused by heart valve problems (valvular heart disease) The heart has four valves — the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid valves. They open and close to move blood through the heart. Many things can damage the heart valves. A heart valve may become narrowed (stenosis), leaky (regurgitation or insufficiency) or close improperly (prolapse). Valvular heart disease is also called heart valve disease. Depending on which valve isn't working properly, heart valve disease symptoms generally include:  Chest pain Fainting (syncope) Fatigue Irregular heartbeat Shortness of breath Swollen feet or ankles  Endocarditis is an infection that affects the heart valves and inner lining of the heart chambers and heart valves (endocardium).

Alcohol poisoning is an emergency If you suspect that someone has alcohol poisoning — even if you don't see the classic signs and symptoms — seek immediate medical care. Here's what to do:  Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Never assume the person will sleep off alcohol poisoning. Be prepared to provide information. If you know, be sure to tell hospital or emergency personnel the kind and amount of alcohol the person drank, and when. Don't leave an unconscious person alone. Because alcohol poisoning affects the way the gag reflex works, someone with alcohol poisoning may choke on his or her own vomit and not be able to breathe. While waiting for help, don't try to make the person vomit because he or she could choke. Help a person who is vomiting. Try to keep him or her sitting up. If the person must lie down, make sure to turn his or her head to the side — this helps prevent choking. Try to keep the person awake to prevent loss of consciousness.

"Signs and symptoms depend on the type of dissociative disorders you have, but may include:  Memory loss (amnesia) of certain time periods, events, people and personal information A sense of being detached from yourself and your emotions A perception of the people and things around you as distorted and unreal A blurred sense of identity Significant stress or problems in your relationships, work or other important areas of your life Inability to cope well with emotional or professional stress Mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors  There are three major dissociative disorders defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association:  Dissociative amnesia. The main symptom is memory loss that's more severe than normal forgetfulness and that can't be explained by a medical condition. You can't recall information about yourself or events and people in your life, especially from a traumatic time. Dissociative amnesia can be specific to events in a certain time, such as intense combat, or more rarely, can involve complete loss of memory about yourself. It may sometimes involve travel or confused wandering away from your life (dissociative fugue). An episode of amnesia usually occurs suddenly and may last minutes, hours, or rarely, months or years. Dissociative identity disorder. Formerly known as multiple personality disorder, this disorder is characterized by ""switching"" to alternate identities. You may feel the presence of two or more people talking or living inside your head, and you may feel as though you're possessed by other identities. Each identity may have a unique name, personal history and characteristics, including obvious differences in voice, gender, mannerisms and even such physical qualities as the need for eyeglasses. There also are differences in how familiar each identity is with the others. People with dissociative identity disorder typically also have dissociative amnesia and often have dissociative fugue. Depersonalization-derealization disorder. This involves an ongoing or episodic sense of detachment or being outside yourself — observing your actions, feelings, thoughts and self from a distance as though watching a movie (depersonalization). Other people and things around you may feel detached and foggy or dreamlike, time may be slowed down or sped up, and the world may seem unreal (derealization). You may experience depersonalization, derealization or both. Symptoms, which can be profoundly distressing, may last only a few moments or come and go over many years.  When to see a doctor Some people with dissociative disorders present in a crisis with traumatic flashbacks that are overwhelming or associated with unsafe behavior. People with these symptoms should be seen in an emergency room. If you or a loved one has less urgent symptoms that may indicate a dissociative disorder, call your doctor. Suicidal thoughts or behavior If you have thoughts of hurting yourself or someone else, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend.

Movement and coordination  Stiff muscles and exaggerated reflexes (spasticity), the most common movement disorder Variations in muscle tone, such as being either too stiff or too floppy Stiff muscles with normal reflexes (rigidity) Lack of balance and muscle coordination (ataxia) Tremors or jerky involuntary movements Slow, writhing movements Favoring one side of the body, such as only reaching with one hand or dragging a leg while crawling Difficulty walking, such as walking on toes, a crouched gait, a scissors-like gait with knees crossing, a wide gait or an asymmetrical gait Difficulty with fine motor skills, such as buttoning clothes or picking up utensils  Speech and eating  Delays in speech development Difficulty speaking Difficulty with sucking, chewing or eating Excessive drooling or problems with swallowing  Development  Delays in reaching motor skills milestones, such as sitting up or crawling Learning difficulties Intellectual disabilities Delayed growth, resulting in smaller size than would be expected  Other problems Damage to the brain can contribute to other neurological problems, such as:  Seizures (epilepsy) Difficulty hearing Problems with vision and abnormal eye movements Abnormal touch or pain sensations Bladder and bowel problems, including constipation and urinary incontinence Mental health conditions, such as emotional disorders and behavioral problems  The brain disorder causing cerebral palsy doesn't change with time, so the symptoms usually don't worsen with age.

The condition may be discovered when an electrocardiogram (ECG) or genetic testing is done for other reasons. Fainting (syncope) is the most common symptom of long QT syndrome. A fainting spell from long QT syndrome can occur with little to no warning. Some people have fainting warning signs first, including:  Blurred vision Lightheadedness Pounding heartbeats (palpitations) Weakness  Fainting occurs when the heart temporarily beats in an unorganized way. You might faint when you're excited, angry or scared or during exercise. Things that startle you — for example, a telephone or an alarm clock — can cause you to lose consciousness. Long QT syndrome may also cause seizures in some people. Symptoms of long QT syndrome sometimes occur during sleep. Most people with symptoms of LQTS have their first episode by age 40. When the condition is present at birth (congenital long QT syndrome), symptoms may occur during the first weeks to months of life or later in childhood.

The usual period from initial infection to the time symptoms appear (incubation period) is 3 to 6 days. Children may get a fever and develop a sore throat. They sometimes lose their appetites and don't feel well. One or two days after the fever begins, painful sores may develop in the front of the mouth or throat. A rash on the hands and feet and sometimes on the buttocks may also appear. Sores that develop in the back of the mouth and throat may suggest a related viral illness called herpangina. Other features of herpangina include a sudden high fever and, in some instances, seizure.

"Mild atherosclerosis usually doesn't have any symptoms. Atherosclerosis symptoms usually don't happen until an artery is so narrowed or clogged that it can't supply enough blood to organs and tissues. Sometimes a blood clot completely blocks blood flow. The clot may break apart and can trigger a heart attack or stroke. Symptoms of moderate to severe atherosclerosis depend on which arteries are affected. For example:  If you have atherosclerosis in your heart arteries, you may have chest pain or pressure (angina). If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your brain, you may have sudden numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, difficulty speaking or slurred speech, temporary loss of vision in one eye, or drooping muscles in your face. These signal a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Untreated, a TIA can lead to a stroke. If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries in your arms and legs, you may have symptoms of peripheral artery disease, such as leg pain when walking (claudication) or decreased blood pressure in an affected limb. If you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your kidneys, you may develop high blood pressure or kidney failure.

"Throughout the menopausal transition, some subtle — and some not-so-subtle — changes in your body may take place. You might experience:  Irregular periods. As ovulation becomes more unpredictable, the length of time between periods may be longer or shorter, your flow may be light to heavy, and you may skip some periods. If you have a persistent change of seven days or more in the length of your menstrual cycle, you may be in early perimenopause. If you have a space of 60 days or more between periods, you're likely in late perimenopause. Hot flashes and sleep problems. Hot flashes are common during perimenopause. The intensity, length and frequency vary. Sleep problems are often due to hot flashes or night sweats, but sometimes sleep becomes unpredictable even without them. Mood changes. Mood swings, irritability or increased risk of depression may happen during perimenopause. The cause of these symptoms may be sleep disruption associated with hot flashes. Mood changes may also be caused by factors not related to the hormonal changes of perimenopause. Vaginal and bladder problems. When estrogen levels diminish, your vaginal tissues may lose lubrication and elasticity, making intercourse painful. Low estrogen may also leave you more vulnerable to urinary or vaginal infections. Loss of tissue tone may contribute to urinary incontinence. Decreasing fertility. As ovulation becomes irregular, your ability to conceive decreases. However, as long as you're having periods, pregnancy is still possible. If you wish to avoid pregnancy, use birth control until you've had no periods for 12 months. Changes in sexual function. During perimenopause, sexual arousal and desire may change. But if you had satisfactory sexual intimacy before menopause, this will likely continue through perimenopause and beyond. Loss of bone. With declining estrogen levels, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it, increasing your risk of osteoporosis — a disease that causes fragile bones. Changing cholesterol levels. Declining estrogen levels may lead to unfavorable changes in your blood cholesterol levels, including an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the ""bad"" cholesterol — which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease. At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol — the ""good"" cholesterol — decreases in many women as they age, which also increases the risk of heart disease.

"The symptoms of HIV and AIDS vary, depending on the phase of infection. HIV AIDS Primary infection (Acute HIV) Some people infected by HIV develop a flu-like illness within 2 to 4 weeks after the virus enters the body. This illness, known as primary (acute) HIV infection, may last for a few weeks. HIV HIV Possible signs and symptoms include:  Fever Headache Muscle aches and joint pain Rash Sore throat and painful mouth sores Swollen lymph glands, mainly on the neck Diarrhea Weight loss Cough Night sweats  These symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. However, the amount of virus in your bloodstream (viral load) is quite high at this time. As a result, the infection spreads more easily during primary infection than during the next stage. Clinical latent infection (Chronic HIV) In this stage of infection, HIV is still present in the body and in white blood cells. However, many people may not have any symptoms or infections during this time. HIV This stage can last for many years if you're receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Some people develop more severe disease much sooner. Symptomatic HIV infection As the virus continues to multiply and destroy your immune cells — the cells in your body that help fight off germs — you may develop mild infections or chronic signs and symptoms such as:  Fever Fatigue Swollen lymph nodes — often one of the first signs of HIV infection Diarrhea Weight loss Oral yeast infection (thrush) Shingles (herpes zoster) Pneumonia  Progression to AIDS Access to better antiviral treatments has dramatically decreased deaths from AIDS worldwide, even in resource-poor countries. Thanks to these life-saving treatments, most people with HIV in the U.S. today don't develop AIDS. Untreated, HIV typically turns into AIDS in about 8 to 10 years. AIDS HIV AIDS HIV AIDS When AIDS occurs, your immune system has been severely damaged. You'll be more likely to develop diseases that wouldn't usually cause illness in a person with a healthy immune system. These are called opportunistic infections or opportunistic cancers.

The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover the entire body with a peeling, itchy rash. Common signs and symptoms of psoriasis include:  A patchy rash that varies widely in how it looks from person to person, ranging from spots of dandruff-like scaling to major eruptions over much of the body Rashes that vary in color, tending to be shades of purple with gray scale on brown or Black skin and pink or red with silver scale on white skin Small scaling spots (commonly seen in children) Dry, cracked skin that may bleed Itching, burning or soreness Cyclic rashes that flare for a few weeks or months and then subside  There are several types of psoriasis, each of which varies in its signs and symptoms:  Plaque psoriasis. The most common type of psoriasis, plaque psoriasis causes dry, itchy, raised skin patches (plaques) covered with scales. There may be few or many. They usually appear on the elbows, knees, lower back and scalp. The patches vary in color, depending on skin color. The affected skin might heal with temporary changes in color (post inflammatory hyperpigmentation), particularly on brown or Black skin. Nail psoriasis. Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Psoriatic nails might loosen and separate from the nail bed (onycholysis). Severe disease may cause the nail to crumble. Guttate psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis primarily affects young adults and children. It's usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throat. It's marked by small, drop-shaped, scaling spots on the trunk, arms or legs. Inverse psoriasis. Inverse psoriasis mainly affects the skin folds of the groin, buttocks and breasts. It causes smooth patches of inflamed skin that worsen with friction and sweating. Fungal infections may trigger this type of psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis, a rare type, causes clearly defined pus-filled blisters. It can occur in widespread patches or on small areas of the palms or soles. Erythrodermic psoriasis. The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover the entire body with a peeling rash that can itch or burn intensely. It can be short-lived (acute) or long-term (chronic).

"Chondrosarcoma tends to grow slowly, so it might not cause signs and symptoms at first. When they occur, signs and symptoms of chondrosarcoma may include:  Increasing pain A growing lump or area of swelling Weakness or bowel and bladder control problems, if the cancer presses on the spinal cord  Causes It's not clear what causes chondrosarcoma. Doctors know that cancer begins when a cell develops changes (mutations) in its DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell it what to do. The instructions tell the cell to multiply quickly and to continue living when healthy cells would die. The accumulating cells form a tumor that can grow to invade and destroy normal body tissue. In time, cells can break away and spread (metastasize) to other areas of the body. Risk factors Factors that can increase the risk of chondrosarcoma include:  Increasing age. Chondrosarcoma occurs most often in middle-aged and older adults, though it can occur at any age. Other bone diseases. Ollier's disease and Maffucci's syndrome are conditions that cause noncancerous bone growths (enchondromas) in the body. These growths sometimes transform into chondrosarcoma.

See a doctor if:  You suddenly begin to sweat much more or less than usual Sweating disrupts your daily routine You experience night sweats for no apparent reason You notice a change in your body odor  Causes Sweating and body odor are caused by sweat glands in your body. The two main types of sweat glands are eccrine glands and apocrine glands. Eccrine glands occur over most of your body and open directly onto the surface of the skin. When your body temperature rises, these glands release fluids that cool your body as they evaporate. Apocrine glands are found in areas where you have hair, such as your armpits and groin. These glands release a milky fluid when you're stressed. This fluid is odorless until it combines with bacteria on your skin.

"If you're allergic to latex, you're likely to have symptoms after touching latex rubber products, such as gloves or balloons. You also can have symptoms if you breathe in latex particles that are released into the air when someone removes latex gloves. Latex allergy symptoms range from mild to severe. A reaction depends on how sensitive you are to latex and the amount of latex you touch or inhale. Your reaction can become worse with each additional latex exposure. Mild symptoms Mild latex allergy symptoms include:  Itching Skin redness Hives or rash  More-severe symptoms These include:  Sneezing Runny nose Itchy, watery eyes Scratchy throat Difficulty breathing Wheezing Cough  Life-threatening symptoms: Anaphylaxis The most serious allergic reaction to latex is anaphylaxis, which can be deadly. An anaphylactic (an-uh-fuh-LAK-tik) reaction develops immediately after latex exposure in highly sensitive people. However, it rarely happens the first time you're exposed.

"The first symptoms of hoarding disorder often appear during the teenage to early adult years. You may get and save too many items, gradually build up clutter in living spaces, and have difficulty getting rid of things. As you grow older, you may continue getting and holding onto things that you may never use and don't have space for. By middle age, the clutter can become overwhelming as symptoms become more severe and increasingly difficult to treat. Problems with hoarding gradually develop over time and tend to be a private behavior. You may avoid having family, friends or repair workers in your home. Often, major clutter has developed by the time it reaches the attention of others. Symptoms of hoarding disorder may include:  Getting and keeping too many items that you may not have a need for right now and don't have space for. Ongoing difficulty throwing out or parting with your things, regardless of their actual value. Feeling a need to save these items and being upset by the thought of getting rid of them. Building up clutter to the point where you can't use rooms. Trying to be perfect and avoiding or delaying decisions. Problems with planning and organizing.  Getting too many items and refusing to part with them results in:  Disorganized piles or stacks of items, such as newspapers, clothes, paperwork, books or sentimental items. Items that crowd and clutter your walking spaces and living areas. Rooms can't be used for the intended purpose, such as not being able to sleep in your bed. Buildup of food or trash to large, unsanitary levels. Distress or problems functioning or keeping yourself, others and pets safe in your home. Conflict with others who try to reduce or remove clutter from your home. Relationship issues, avoiding social activities and employment problems. Difficulty organizing items and sometimes losing important items in the clutter.  With hoarding disorder, items are usually saved because:  You believe these items are unique or that you'll need them at some point in the future. You feel emotionally connected to items that remind you of happier times or represent beloved people or pets. You feel safe and comforted when surrounded by things. You don't want to waste anything.  Hoarding disorder is different from collecting. People who have collections, such as stamps or model cars, carefully search out specific items, organize them and display their collections. Collections can be large, but they aren't usually cluttered. Also, they don't cause the distress and problems functioning that are part of hoarding disorder. Hoarding animals People who hoard animals may collect dozens or even hundreds of pets. Animals may be confined inside or outside. Because of the large numbers, these animals often aren't cared for properly. The health and safety of the person and the animals are often at risk because of unsanitary conditions.",485.0,"['first symptoms hoarding disorder teenage early adult years', ' may save items', ' gradually build clutter living spaces', ' difficulty rid things', ' grow older', "" may continue holding may don't space for"", ' middle age', ' clutter can overwhelming symptoms severe increasingly difficult treat', ' problems hoarding gradually develop time tend private behavior', ' may avoid family', ' friends repair workers home', ' often', ' major clutter developed time reaches attention others', "" symptoms hoarding disorder may include:  keeping items may need right now don't space for"", ' ongoing difficulty throwing parting things', ' regardless actual value', ' feeling need save items being upset thought rid them', "" building clutter point can't rooms"", ' trying perfect avoiding delaying decisions', ' problems planning organizing', '  items refusing part results in:  disorganized piles stacks items', ' newspapers', ' clothes', ' paperwork', ' books sentimental items', ' items crowd clutter walking spaces living areas', "" rooms can't intended purpose"", ' being able sleep bed', ' buildup food trash large', ' unsanitary levels', ' distress problems functioning keeping yourself', ' pets safe home', ' conflict who try reduce remove clutter home', ' relationship issues', ' avoiding social activities employment problems', ' difficulty organizing items losing important items clutter', '  hoarding disorder', "" items because:  believe items unique you'll need point future"", ' feel emotionally connected items remind happier times represent beloved people pets', ' feel safe comforted surrounded things', "" don't want waste anything"", '  hoarding disorder collecting', ' people who collections', ' stamps model cars', ' carefully search specific items', ' organize display collections', ' collections can large', "" aren't cluttered"", ' also', "" don't cause distress problems functioning part hoarding disorder"", ' hoarding animals people who hoard animals may collect dozens hundreds pets', ' animals may confined inside outside', ' large numbers', "" animals aren't cared properly"", ' health safety person animals risk unsanitary conditions', '']",['hoarding disorder']

"Breast tissue normally might feel lumpy or ropy and you may have tenderness that comes and goes with your menstrual period.  If you have an underlying breast condition, you might notice changes in how your breasts normally feel, such as:  A round, smooth and firm breast lump A large, solid-feeling lump that moves easily under your skin A hard, irregular-shaped breast lump Skin redness or dimpling like an orange Changes in breast size or shape Fluid leaking from your nipple  Causes Breast lumps can result from:  Breast cysts. If you find a breast lump that feels round, smooth and firm, it could be a cyst — a dilated milk duct filled with fluid. A breast cyst can be large or small, and the surrounding breast tissue may be tender. A breast cyst may appear before your menstrual period and get smaller or disappear afterward. Fibrocystic breast changes. With fibrocystic breast changes, you may feel fullness in your breasts with areas of lumpiness or ridgelike areas. Your breasts may feel tender. Many women experience fibrocystic breast changes related to their menstrual cycles that tend to improve after the menstrual cycle. Fibroadenomas. Fibroadenomas are solid, noncancerous breast tumors that are smooth and move easily under your skin when touched. A fibroadenoma may grow larger. Factors that may be associated with fibroadenoma growth include being pregnant, using hormone therapy or menstruation. Injuries and infections. A severe injury to your breast tissue or nearby nerves can create a breast lump. Doctors describe this condition as fat necrosis. A collection of infected fluid (abscess) in breast tissue also can cause a breast lump, one that's often associated with localized breast pain and inflammation of the skin. Breast cancer. A breast lump that's painless, hard, irregularly shaped and different from surrounding breast tissue might be breast cancer. Skin covering the lump may look red, dimpled or pitted like the skin of an orange. Your breast size and shape may change, or you may notice discharge from the nipple.  Only by seeing your doctor for evaluation can you be certain of what kinds of tests you might need and which type of breast lump you have.

"Signs and symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome) can vary in type and severity, depending on what body systems are affected and how severe the defects are. Some signs and symptoms may be apparent at birth, but others may not appear until later in infancy or early childhood. Signs and symptoms may include some combination of the following:  Heart murmur and bluish skin due to poor circulation of oxygen-rich blood (cyanosis) as a result of a heart defect Frequent infections Certain facial features, such as an underdeveloped chin, low-set ears, wide-set eyes or a narrow groove in the upper lip A gap in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) or other problems with the palate Delayed growth Difficulty feeding, failure to gain weight or gastrointestinal problems Breathing problems Poor muscle tone Delayed development, such as delays in rolling over, sitting up or other infant milestones Delayed speech development or nasal-sounding speech Learning delays or disabilities Behavior problems  When to see a doctor Other conditions may cause signs and symptoms similar to 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.

"The main sign of FAP is hundreds or even thousands of polyps growing in your colon and rectum, usually starting by your mid-teens. The polyps are nearly 100 percent certain to develop into colon cancer or rectal cancer by the time you're in your 40s. Causes Familial adenomatous polyposis is caused by a defect in a gene that's usually inherited from a parent. But some people develop the abnormal gene that causes the condition. Risk factors Your risk of familial adenomatous polyposis is higher if you have a parent, child, brother, or sister with the condition.                   Complications In addition to colon cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis can cause other complications:  Duodenal polyps. These polyps grow in the upper part of your small intestine and may become cancerous. But with careful monitoring, duodenal polyps can often be detected and removed before cancer develops. Periampullary polyps. These polyps occur where the bile and pancreas ducts enter the duodenum (ampulla). Periampullary polyps might become cancerous but can often be detected and removed before cancer develops. Gastric fundic polyps. These polyps grow in the lining of your stomach. Desmoids. These noncancerous masses can arise anywhere in the body but often develop in the stomach area (abdomen). Desmoids can cause serious problems if they grow into nerves or blood vessels or exert pressure on other organs in your body. Other cancers. Rarely, FAP can cause cancer to develop in your thyroid gland, central nervous system, adrenal glands, liver or other organs. Noncancerous (benign) skin tumors. Benign bone growths (osteomas). Congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). These are benign pigment changes in the retina of your eye. Dental abnormalities. These include extra teeth or teeth that don't come in. Low numbers of red blood cells (anemia).  Prevention Preventing FAP is not possible, since it is an inherited genetic condition. However, if you or your child is at risk of FAP because of a family member with the condition, you will need genetic testing and counseling. If you have FAP, you will need regular screening, followed by surgery if needed. Surgery can help prevent the development of colorectal cancer or other complications.

"Many people experience no signs or symptoms of a dengue infection.

In some cases, symptoms worsen and can become life-threatening. This is called severe dengue, dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. Severe dengue happens when your blood vessels become damaged and leaky. And the number of clot-forming cells (platelets) in your bloodstream drops.

"Some children show signs of autism spectrum disorder in early infancy, such as reduced eye contact, lack of response to their name or indifference to caregivers. Other children may develop normally for the first few months or years of life, but then suddenly become withdrawn or aggressive or lose language skills they've already acquired. Signs usually are seen by age 2 years. Each child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior and level of severity — from low functioning to high functioning. Some children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty learning, and some have signs of lower than normal intelligence. Other children with the disorder have normal to high intelligence — they learn quickly, yet have trouble communicating and applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations. Because of the unique mixture of symptoms in each child, severity can sometimes be difficult to determine. It's generally based on the level of impairments and how they impact the ability to function. Below are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder. Social communication and interaction A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have problems with social interaction and communication skills, including any of these signs:  Fails to respond to his or her name or appears not to hear you at times Resists cuddling and holding, and seems to prefer playing alone, retreating into his or her own world Has poor eye contact and lacks facial expression Doesn't speak or has delayed speech, or loses previous ability to say words or sentences Can't start a conversation or keep one going, or only starts one to make requests or label items Speaks with an abnormal tone or rhythm and may use a singsong voice or robot-like speech Repeats words or phrases verbatim, but doesn't understand how to use them Doesn't appear to understand simple questions or directions Doesn't express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others' feelings Doesn't point at or bring objects to share interest Inappropriately approaches a social interaction by being passive, aggressive or disruptive Has difficulty recognizing nonverbal cues, such as interpreting other people's facial expressions, body postures or tone of voice  Patterns of behavior A child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have limited, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities, including any of these signs:  Performs repetitive movements, such as rocking, spinning or hand flapping Performs activities that could cause self-harm, such as biting or head-banging Develops specific routines or rituals and becomes disturbed at the slightest change Has problems with coordination or has odd movement patterns, such as clumsiness or walking on toes, and has odd, stiff or exaggerated body language Is fascinated by details of an object, such as the spinning wheels of a toy car, but doesn't understand the overall purpose or function of the object Is unusually sensitive to light, sound or touch, yet may be indifferent to pain or temperature Doesn't engage in imitative or make-believe play Fixates on an object or activity with abnormal intensity or focus Has specific food preferences, such as eating only a few foods, or refusing foods with a certain texture  As they mature, some children with autism spectrum disorder become more engaged with others and show fewer disturbances in behavior. Some, usually those with the least severe problems, eventually may lead normal or near-normal lives.

"Signs and symptoms depend on the type of adjustment disorder and can vary from person to person. You experience more stress than would normally be expected in response to a stressful event, and the stress causes significant problems in your life. Adjustment disorders affect how you feel and think about yourself and the world and may also affect your actions or behavior. Some examples include:  Feeling sad, hopeless or not enjoying things you used to enjoy Frequent crying Worrying or feeling anxious, nervous, jittery or stressed out Trouble sleeping Lack of appetite Difficulty concentrating Feeling overwhelmed Difficulty functioning in daily activities Withdrawing from social supports Avoiding important things such as going to work or paying bills Suicidal thoughts or behavior  Symptoms of an adjustment disorder start within three months of a stressful event and last no longer than 6 months after the end of the stressful event. However, persistent or chronic adjustment disorders can continue for more than 6 months, especially if the stressor is ongoing, such as unemployment. When to see a doctor Usually stressors are temporary, and we learn to cope with them over time. Symptoms of adjustment disorder get better because the stress has eased. But sometimes the stressful event remains a part of your life. Or a new stressful situation comes up, and you face the same emotional struggles all over again. Talk to your doctor if you continue to struggle or if you're having trouble getting through each day. You can get treatment to help you cope better with stressful events and feel better about life again. If you have concerns about your child's adjustment or behavior, talk with your child's pediatrician. Suicidal thoughts or behavior If you have thoughts of hurting yourself or someone else, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend.

"Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms may start within one month of a traumatic event, but sometimes symptoms may not appear until years after the event. These symptoms cause significant problems in social or work situations and in relationships. They can also interfere with your ability to go about your normal daily tasks. PTSD symptoms are generally grouped into four types: intrusive memories, avoidance, negative changes in thinking and mood, and changes in physical and emotional reactions. Symptoms can vary over time or vary from person to person. Intrusive memories Intrusive memories Symptoms of intrusive memories may include:  Recurrent, unwanted distressing memories of the traumatic event Reliving the traumatic event as if it were happening again (flashbacks) Upsetting dreams or nightmares about the traumatic event Severe emotional distress or physical reactions to something that reminds you of the traumatic event  Avoidance Avoidance Symptoms of avoidance may include:  Trying to avoid thinking or talking about the traumatic event Avoiding places, activities or people that remind you of the traumatic event  Negative changes in thinking and mood Negative changes in thinking and mood Symptoms of negative changes in thinking and mood may include:  Negative thoughts about yourself, other people or the world Hopelessness about the future Memory problems, including not remembering important aspects of the traumatic event Difficulty maintaining close relationships Feeling detached from family and friends Lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed Difficulty experiencing positive emotions Feeling emotionally numb  Changes in physical and emotional reactions Changes in physical and emotional reactions Symptoms of changes in physical and emotional reactions (also called arousal symptoms) may include:  Being easily startled or frightened Always being on guard for danger Self-destructive behavior, such as drinking too much or driving too fast Trouble sleeping Trouble concentrating Irritability, angry outbursts or aggressive behavior Overwhelming guilt or shame  For children 6 years old and younger, signs and symptoms may also include:  Re-enacting the traumatic event or aspects of the traumatic event through play Frightening dreams that may or may not include aspects of the traumatic event  Intensity of symptoms Intensity of symptoms PTSD symptoms can vary in intensity over time. You may have more PTSD symptoms when you're stressed in general, or when you come across reminders of what you went through. For example, you may hear a car backfire and relive combat experiences. Or you may see a report on the news about a sexual assault and feel overcome by memories of your own assault. When to see a doctor When to see a doctor If you have disturbing thoughts and feelings about a traumatic event for more than a month, if they're severe, or if you feel you're having trouble getting your life back under control, talk to your doctor or a mental health professional.

"Signs and symptoms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma include:  Round patches of skin that may be raised or scaly and might be itchy Patches of skin that appear lighter in color than surrounding skin Lumps that form on the skin and may break open Enlarged lymph nodes Hair loss Thickening of the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet A rash-like skin redness over the entire body that is intensely itchy  Causes The exact cause of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma isn't known. In general, cancer begins when cells develop changes (mutations) in their DNA. A cell's DNA contains instructions that tell a cell what to do. The DNA mutations tell the cells to grow and multiply rapidly, creating many abnormal cells. In cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, the mutations cause too many abnormal T cells that attack the skin. T cells are part of your immune system, and they normally help your body fight germs. Doctors don't know why the cells attack the skin.

It appears as a painless, flesh-colored or bluish-red nodule growing on your skin. Skin cancer develops primarily on areas of sun-exposed skin, including the scalp, face, lips, ears, neck, chest, arms and hands, and on the legs in women. But it can also form on areas that rarely see the light of day — your palms, beneath your fingernails or toenails, and your genital area. Skin cancer affects people of all skin tones, including those with darker complexions. When melanoma occurs in people with dark skin tones, it's more likely to occur in areas not normally exposed to the sun, such as the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Basal cell carcinoma signs and symptoms Basal cell carcinoma usually occurs in sun-exposed areas of your body, such as your neck or face. Basal cell carcinoma may appear as:  A pearly or waxy bump A flat, flesh-colored or brown scar-like lesion A bleeding or scabbing sore that heals and returns  Squamous cell carcinoma signs and symptoms Most often, squamous cell carcinoma occurs on sun-exposed areas of your body, such as your face, ears and hands. People with darker skin are more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma on areas that aren't often exposed to the sun. Squamous cell carcinoma may appear as:  A firm, red nodule A flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface  Melanoma signs and symptoms Melanoma can develop anywhere on your body, in otherwise normal skin or in an existing mole that becomes cancerous. Melanoma most often appears on the face or the trunk of affected men. In women, this type of cancer most often develops on the lower legs. In both men and women, melanoma can occur on skin that hasn't been exposed to the sun. Melanoma can affect people of any skin tone. In people with darker skin tones, melanoma tends to occur on the palms or soles, or under the fingernails or toenails. Melanoma signs include:  A large brownish spot with darker speckles A mole that changes in color, size or feel or that bleeds A small lesion with an irregular border and portions that appear red, pink, white, blue or blue-black A painful lesion that itches or burns Dark lesions on your palms, soles, fingertips or toes, or on mucous membranes lining your mouth, nose, vagina or anus  Signs and symptoms of less common skin cancers Other, less common types of skin cancer include:  Kaposi sarcoma. This rare form of skin cancer develops in the skin's blood vessels and causes red or purple patches on the skin or mucous membranes. Kaposi sarcoma mainly occurs in people with weakened immune systems, such as people with AIDS, and in people taking medications that suppress their natural immunity, such as people who've undergone organ transplants. Other people with an increased risk of Kaposi sarcoma include young men living in Africa or older men of Italian or Eastern European Jewish heritage.  Merkel cell carcinoma. Merkel cell carcinoma causes firm, shiny nodules that occur on or just beneath the skin and in hair follicles. Merkel cell carcinoma is most often found on the head, neck and trunk. Sebaceous gland carcinoma. This uncommon and aggressive cancer originates in the oil glands in the skin. Sebaceous gland carcinomas — which usually appear as hard, painless nodules — can develop anywhere, but most occur on the eyelid, where they're frequently mistaken for other eyelid problems.

"The signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism usually develop gradually and get worse over time. They are sometimes subtle and may be overlooked for months or even years. But for some people, signs and symptoms develop suddenly. Signs and symptoms of hypopituitarism vary from person to person, depending on which pituitary hormones are affected and to what degree. In people who have more than one pituitary hormone deficiency, the second deficiency may increase or, in some cases, hide the symptoms of the first deficiency. Growth hormone (GH) deficiency In children, GH deficiency may cause growth problems and short stature. Most adults who have GH deficiency don't have any symptoms, but for some adults it can cause: GH GH  Fatigue Muscle weakness Changes in body fat composition Lack of ambition Social isolation  Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) deficiency Deficiency of these hormones, called gonadotropins, affect the reproductive system. In women, the deficiency decreases egg and estrogen production from the ovaries. In men, the deficiency decreases sperm and testosterone production from the testicles. Women and men may experience a lower sex drive, infertility or fatigue. In children and adolescents, delayed puberty is usually the only symptom. Women may also have symptoms such as:  Hot flashes Irregular or no periods Loss of pubic hair An inability to produce milk for breast-feeding  Men may also have symptoms such as:  Erectile dysfunction Decreased facial or body hair Mood changes  Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency This hormone controls the thyroid gland. A TSH deficiency leads to low levels of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism). This causes symptoms such as: TSH  Fatigue Weight gain Dry skin Constipation Sensitivity to cold or difficulty staying warm  Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency This hormone helps your adrenal glands work properly, and helps your body react to stress. Symptoms of ACTH deficiency include: ACTH  Severe fatigue Low blood pressure, which may lead to fainting Frequent and prolonged infections Nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain Confusion  Anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) deficiency This hormone, which is also called vasopressin, helps your body balance its fluid levels. An ADH deficiency can cause a disorder called diabetes insipidus, which can cause: ADH  Excessive urination Extreme thirst Electrolyte imbalances  Prolactin deficiency Prolactin is the hormone that tells the body when to start making breast milk.

"Symptoms of delirium usually begin over a few hours or a few days. They typically occur with a medical problem. Symptoms often come and go during the day. There may be periods of no symptoms. Symptoms tend to be worse at night when it's dark and things look less familiar. They also tend to be worse in settings that aren't familiar, such as in a hospital. Primary symptoms include the following. Reduced awareness of surroundings This may result in:  Trouble focusing on a topic or changing topics Getting stuck on an idea rather than responding to questions Being easily distracted Being withdrawn, with little or no activity or little response to surroundings  Poor thinking skills This may appear as:  Poor memory, such as forgetting recent events Not knowing where they are or who they are Trouble with speech or recalling words Rambling or nonsense speech Trouble understanding speech Trouble reading or writing  Behavior and emotional changes These may include:  Anxiety, fear or distrust of others Depression A short temper or anger A sense of feeling elated Lack of interest and emotion Quick changes in mood Personality changes Seeing things that others don't see Being restless, anxious or combative Calling out, moaning or making other sounds Being quiet and withdrawn — especially in older adults Slowed movement or being sluggish Changes in sleep habits A switched night-day sleep-wake cycle  Types of delirium Experts have identified three types:  Hyperactive delirium. This may be the easiest type to recognize. People with this type may be restless and pace the room. They also may be anxious, have rapid mood swings or see things that aren't there. People with this type often resist care. Hypoactive delirium. People with this type may be inactive or have reduced activity. They tend to be sluggish or drowsy. They might seem to be in a daze. They don't interact with family or others. Mixed delirium. Symptoms involve both types of delirium. The person may quickly switch back and forth from being restless and sluggish.  Delirium and dementia Delirium and dementia may be hard to tell apart, and a person may have both. Someone with dementia has a gradual decline of memory and other thinking skills due to damage or loss of brain cells. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, which comes on slowly over months or years. Delirium often occurs in people with dementia. However, episodes of delirium don't always mean a person has dementia. Tests for dementia shouldn't be done during a delirium episode because the results could be misleading. Some differences between the symptoms of delirium and dementia include:  Onset. The onset of delirium occurs within a short time — within a day or two. Dementia usually begins with minor symptoms that get worse over time. Attention. The ability to stay focused or maintain focus is impaired with delirium. A person in the early stages of dementia remains generally alert. Someone with dementia often isn't sluggish or agitated. Rapid changes in symptoms. Delirium symptoms can come and go several times during the day. While people with dementia have better and worse times of day, their memory and thinking skills typically stay at a constant level.

"There are three general types of thoracic outlet syndrome:  Neurogenic (neurologic) thoracic outlet syndrome. This most common type of thoracic outlet syndrome is characterized by compression of the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is a network of nerves that come from your spinal cord and control muscle movements and sensation in your shoulder, arm and hand. Venous thoracic outlet syndrome. This type of thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when one or more of the veins under the collarbone (clavicle) are compressed, resulting in blood clots. Arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. This is the least common type of TOS. It occurs when one of the arteries under the collarbone is compressed, resulting in bulging of the artery, also known as an aneurysm.  It's possible to have a mix of the three different types of thoracic outlet syndrome, with multiple parts of the thoracic outlet being compressed. Thoracic outlet syndrome symptoms can vary depending on the type.

"A tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of tissue. A cyst is a lesion that contains liquid or semisolid material. Examples of jaw tumors and cysts include:  Ameloblastoma. This rare, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on the teeth. It develops most often in the jaw near the molars. The most common type is aggressive, forming large tumors and growing into the jawbone. Although this tumor can recur after treatment, aggressive surgical treatment will typically reduce the chance of recurrence. Central giant cell granuloma. Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that grow from bone cells. They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. One type of these tumors can grow rapidly, cause pain and destroy bone, and has a tendency to recur after surgical treatment. The other type is less aggressive and may not have symptoms. Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on its own, but typically these tumors require surgical treatment. Dentigerous cyst. This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth. This is the most common form of cyst that affects the jaws. Most often these cysts will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted, but they can also involve other teeth. Odontogenic keratocyst. This cyst is also referred to as a keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment. Although this cyst is typically slow growing, it can still be destructive to the jaw and teeth if left untreated over a long period of time. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cysts may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. Odontogenic myxoma. This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw.

"There are no specific symptoms that indicate a conjoined twin pregnancy. As with other twin pregnancies, the uterus may grow faster than it does with a single baby. And there may be more tiredness, nausea and vomiting early in the pregnancy. Conjoined twins can be diagnosed early in the pregnancy using an ultrasound. How twins are joined Conjoined twins are usually classified according to where they're joined. The twins sometimes share organs or other parts of their bodies. Each pair of conjoined twins is unique. Conjoined twins may be joined at any of these sites:  Chest. Thoracopagus (thor-uh-KOP-uh-gus) twins are joined face to face at the chest. They often have a shared heart and may also share one liver and upper intestine. This is one of the most common sites of conjoined twins. Abdomen. Omphalopagus (om-fuh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined near the bellybutton. Many omphalopagus twins share the liver and some part of the upper digestive (gastrointestinal or GI) tract. Some twins share the lower part of the small intestine (ileum) and the longest part of the large intestine (colon). They generally do not share a heart. Base of spine. Pygopagus (pie-GOP-uh-gus) twins are commonly joined back to back at the base of the spine and the buttocks. Some pygopagus twins share the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A few twins share the genital and urinary organs. Length of spine. Rachipagus (ray-KIP-uh-gus), also called rachiopagus (ray-kee-OP-uh-gus), twins are joined back to back along the length of the spine. This type is very rare. Pelvis. Ischiopagus (is-kee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the pelvis, either face to face or end to end. Many ischiopagus twins share the lower GI tract, as well as the liver and genital and urinary tract organs. Each twin may have two legs or, less commonly, the twins share two or three legs. Trunk. Parapagus (pa-RAP-uh-gus) twins are joined side to side at the pelvis and part or all of the belly (abdomen) and chest, but with separate heads. The twins can have two, three or four arms and two or three legs. Head. Craniopagus (kray-nee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the back, top or side of the head, but not the face. Craniopagus twins share a portion of the skull. But their brains are usually separate, though they may share some brain tissue. Head and chest. Cephalopagus (sef-uh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the head and upper body. The faces are on opposite sides of a single shared head, and they share a brain. These twins rarely survive.  In rare cases, twins may be conjoined with one twin smaller and less fully formed than the other (asymmetric conjoined twins).

"Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors sometimes don't cause symptoms. When they do, signs and symptoms can include:  Stomach ulcers Heartburn Diabetes Weakness Fatigue Muscle cramps Indigestion Diarrhea Weight loss Skin rash Constipation Pain in your abdomen or back Yellowing of your skin or eyes Low blood sugar  Causes It's not clear what causes most pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors occur when hormone-producing cells in the pancreas (islet cells) develop changes (mutations) in their DNA — the material that provides instructions for every chemical process in your body. DNA mutations cause changes in these instructions. One result is that cells may begin to grow out of control and eventually form a tumor — a mass of cancerous cells. Sometimes the cancer cells break away and spread to other organs, such as the liver. Some inherited syndromes increase the risk of this type of cancer, including:  Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome Von Hippel-Lindau disease Von Recklinghausen's disease (neurofibromatosis 1) Tuberous sclerosis  Risk factors Factors that are associated with an increased risk of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors include:  Being male. Men are much more likely than women to develop these tumors. A family history of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. If a family member was diagnosed with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, your risk is increased. You may have multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1) syndrome, which increases the risk of this type of tumor.

"Signs and symptoms of a tension-type headache include:  Dull, aching head pain Sensation of tightness or pressure across the forehead or on the sides and back of the head Tenderness in the scalp, neck and shoulder muscles  Tension-type headaches are divided into two main categories — episodic and chronic. Episodic tension-type headaches Episodic tension-type headaches can last from 30 minutes to a week. Frequent episodic tension-type headaches occur less than 15 days a month for at least three months. Frequent episodic tension-type headaches may become chronic. Chronic tension-type headaches This type of tension-type headache lasts hours and may be continuous. If your headaches occur 15 or more days a month for at least three months, they're considered chronic. Tension-type headaches versus migraines Tension-type headaches can be difficult to distinguish from migraines. Plus, if you have frequent episodic tension-type headaches, you can also have migraines. Unlike some forms of migraine, tension-type headaches usually aren't associated with visual disturbances, nausea or vomiting. Although physical activity typically aggravates migraine pain, it doesn't make tension-type headache pain worse.

"If you have schizoid personality disorder, it's likely that you:  Prefer being alone and choose to do activities alone Don't want or enjoy close relationships Feel little if any desire for sexual relationships Feel like you can't experience pleasure Have difficulty expressing emotions and reacting appropriately to situations May seem humorless, indifferent or emotionally cold to others May appear to lack motivation and goals Don't react to praise or critical remarks from others  Schizoid personality disorder usually begins by early adulthood, though some features may be noticeable during childhood.

Common signs and symptoms during a headache include:  Excruciating pain that is generally situated in, behind or around one eye, but may radiate to other areas of your face, head and neck One-sided pain Restlessness Excessive tearing Redness of your eye on the affected side Stuffy or runny nose on the affected side Forehead or facial sweating on the affected side Pale skin (pallor) or flushing on your face Swelling around your eye on the affected side Drooping eyelid on the affected side  People with cluster headache, unlike those with migraine, are likely to pace or sit and rock back and forth. Some migraine-like symptoms — including sensitivity to light and sound — can occur with a cluster headache, though usually on one side. Cluster period characteristics A cluster period generally lasts for several weeks to months. The starting date and the duration of each cluster period might be consistent from period to period. For example, cluster periods can occur seasonally, such as every spring or every fall. Most people have episodic cluster headaches. In episodic cluster headaches, the headaches occur for one week to a year, followed by a pain-free remission period lasting 3 months or longer before another cluster headache develops. Chronic cluster periods might continue for more than a year, or pain-free periods might last less than one month. During a cluster period:  Headaches usually occur every day, sometimes several times a day A single attack can last from 15 minutes to three hours The attacks often occur at the same time each day Most attacks occur at night, usually 1 to 2 hours after you go to bed  The pain usually ends as suddenly as it began, with rapidly decreasing intensity.

"The symptoms of an alpha-gal allergic reaction usually take longer to start compared with those of other food allergies. Most reactions to common food allergens — peanuts or shellfish, for example — happen within minutes after you are exposed to them. In alpha-gal syndrome, reactions usually appear about 3 to 6 hours after you are exposed. Foods that can cause a reaction include:  Red meat, such as beef, pork or lamb. Organ meats. Products made from mammals, such as gelatins or dairy products.  Symptoms of alpha-gal syndrome may include:  Hives, itching, or itchy, scaly skin. Swelling of the lips, face, tongue and throat, or other body parts. Wheezing or shortness of breath. Stomach pain, diarrhea, upset stomach or vomiting.  The time delay between eating meat products and getting an allergic reaction may be one reason alpha-gal syndrome was not understood at first. For example, a possible connection between a T-bone steak with dinner and hives at midnight is far from clear. Researchers think they know the reason for the delayed reaction.

"Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognition), behavior and emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. Symptoms may include:  Delusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; certain gestures or comments are directed at you; you have exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia. Hallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination. Disorganized thinking (speech). Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad. Extremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in a number of ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior isn't focused on a goal, so it's hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement. Negative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw or lack the ability to experience pleasure.  Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. In men, schizophrenia symptoms typically start in the early to mid-20s. In women, symptoms typically begin in the late 20s. It's uncommon for children to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and rare for those older than age 45. Symptoms in teenagers Schizophrenia symptoms in teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize. This may be in part because some of the early symptoms of schizophrenia in teenagers are common for typical development during teen years, such as:  Withdrawal from friends and family A drop in performance at school Trouble sleeping Irritability or depressed mood Lack of motivation  Also, recreational substance use, such as marijuana, methamphetamines or LSD, can sometimes cause similar signs and symptoms.

"Adults and children who have familial hypercholesterolemia have very high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in their blood. LDL cholesterol is known as ""bad"" cholesterol because it can build up in the walls of the arteries, making them hard and narrow. LDL This excess cholesterol is sometimes deposited in certain portions of the skin, some tendons and around the iris of the eyes:  Skin. The most common spots for cholesterol deposits to occur is on the hands, elbows and knees. They also can occur in the skin around the eyes. Tendons. Cholesterol deposits may thicken the Achilles tendon, along with some tendons in the hands. Eyes. High cholesterol levels can cause corneal arcus, a white or gray ring around the iris of the eye. This happens most commonly in older people, but it can occur in younger people who have familial hypercholesterolemia.  Causes Familial hypercholesterolemia is caused by a gene alteration that's passed down from one or both parents. People who have this condition are born with it. This change prevents the body from ridding itself of the type of cholesterol that can build up in the arteries and cause heart disease. Risk factors The risk of familial hypercholesterolemia is higher if one or both of your parents have the gene alteration that causes it. Most people who have the condition receive one affected gene. But in rare cases, a child can get the affected gene from both parents. This can cause a more severe form of the condition. Familial hypercholesterolemia may be more common in certain populations, including:  Ashkenazi Jews Some Lebanese groups French Canadians  Complications People who have familial hypercholesterolemia have a higher risk of heart disease and death at a younger age. Heart attacks may occur before age 50 in men and age 60 in women. The rarer and more severe variety of the condition, if undiagnosed or untreated, can cause death before age 20.

Signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are often worse at night, and may include:  Numbness or reduced ability to feel pain or temperature changes Tingling or burning feeling Sharp pains or cramps Muscle weakness Extreme sensitivity to touch — for some people, even a bedsheet's weight can be painful Serious foot problems, such as ulcers, infections, and bone and joint damage  Autonomic neuropathy The autonomic nervous system controls blood pressure, heart rate, sweating, eyes, bladder, digestive system and sex organs. Diabetes can affect nerves in any of these areas, possibly causing signs and symptoms including:  A lack of awareness that blood sugar levels are low (hypoglycemia unawareness) Drops in blood pressure when rising from sitting or lying down that may cause dizziness or fainting (orthostatic hypotension) Bladder or bowel problems Slow stomach emptying (gastroparesis), causing nausea, vomiting, sensation of fullness and loss of appetite Difficulty swallowing Changes in the way the eyes adjust from light to dark or far to near Increased or decreased sweating Problems with sexual response, such as vaginal dryness in women and erectile dysfunction in men  Proximal neuropathy (diabetic polyradiculopathy) This type of neuropathy often affects nerves in the thighs, hips, buttocks or legs. It can also affect the abdominal and chest area. Symptoms are usually on one side of the body, but may spread to the other side. Proximal neuropathy may include:  Severe pain in the buttock, hip or thigh Weak and shrinking thigh muscles Difficulty rising from a sitting position Chest or abdominal wall pain  Mononeuropathy (focal neuropathy) Mononeuropathy refers to damage to a single, specific nerve. The nerve may be in the face, torso, arm or leg. Mononeuropathy may lead to:  Difficulty focusing or double vision Paralysis on one side of the face Numbness or tingling in the hand or fingers Weakness in the hand that may result in dropping things Pain in the shin or foot Weakness causing difficulty lifting the front part of the foot (foot drop) Pain in the front of the thigh ",291.0,"['types diabetic neuropathy', ' can type type neuropathy', ' symptoms depend type nerves affected', ' usually', ' symptoms develop gradually', ' may notice wrong considerable nerve damage occurred', ' peripheral neuropathy type neuropathy may called distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy', "" it's common type diabetic neuropathy"", ' affects feet legs first', ' followed hands arms', ' signs symptoms peripheral neuropathy worse night', ' may include:  numbness reduced ability feel pain temperature changes tingling burning feeling sharp pains cramps muscle weakness extreme sensitivity touch — people', "" bedsheet's weight can painful foot problems"", ' ulcers', ' infections', ' bone joint damage  autonomic neuropathy autonomic nervous system controls blood pressure', ' heart rate', ' sweating', ' eyes', ' bladder', ' digestive system sex organs', ' diabetes can affect nerves areas', ' possibly causing signs symptoms including:  lack awareness blood sugar levels low (hypoglycemia unawareness) drops blood pressure rising sitting lying down may cause dizziness fainting (orthostatic hypotension) bladder bowel problems slow stomach emptying (gastroparesis)', ' causing nausea', ' vomiting', ' sensation fullness loss appetite difficulty swallowing changes way eyes adjust light dark far near increased decreased sweating problems sexual response', ' vaginal dryness women erectile dysfunction men  proximal neuropathy (diabetic polyradiculopathy) type neuropathy affects nerves thighs', ' hips', ' buttocks legs', ' can affect abdominal chest area', ' symptoms side body', ' may spread side', ' proximal neuropathy may include:  severe pain buttock', ' hip thigh weak shrinking thigh muscles difficulty rising sitting position chest abdominal wall pain  mononeuropathy (focal neuropathy) mononeuropathy refers damage single', ' specific nerve', ' nerve may face', ' torso', ' arm leg', ' mononeuropathy may lead to:  difficulty focusing double vision paralysis side face numbness tingling hand fingers weakness hand may result dropping pain shin foot weakness causing difficulty lifting front part foot (foot drop) pain front thigh ']",['diabetic neuropathy']

"The severity of signs and symptoms of radiation sickness depends on how much radiation you've absorbed. How much you absorb depends on the strength of the radiated energy, the time of your exposures, and the distance between you and the source of radiation. Signs and symptoms are also affected by the type of exposure — such as total or partial body. The severity of radiation sickness also depends on how sensitive the affected tissue is. For instance, the gastrointestinal system and bone marrow are highly sensitive to radiation. Initial signs and symptoms The initial signs and symptoms of treatable radiation sickness are usually nausea and vomiting. The amount of time between exposure and when these symptoms develop is a clue to how much radiation a person has absorbed. After the first round of signs and symptoms, a person with radiation sickness may have a brief period with no apparent illness, followed by the onset of new, more-serious symptoms. If you've had a mild exposure, it may take hours to weeks before any signs and symptoms begin. But with severe exposure, signs and symptoms can begin minutes to days after exposure.

"The signs and symptoms of aspergillosis vary with the type of illness you develop: Allergic reaction Some people with asthma or cystic fibrosis have an allergic reaction to aspergillus mold. Signs and symptoms of this condition, known as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, include:  Fever A cough that may bring up blood or plugs of mucus Worsening asthma  Aspergilloma Certain chronic lung (pulmonary) conditions, such as emphysema, tuberculosis or advanced sarcoidosis, can cause air spaces (cavities) to form in the lungs. When people with lung cavities are also infected with aspergillus, fungus fibers may find their way into the cavities and grow into tangled masses (fungus balls) known as aspergillomas. Aspergillomas may produce no symptoms or cause only a mild cough at first. Over time and without treatment, however, aspergillomas can worsen the underlying chronic lung condition and possibly cause:  A cough that often brings up blood (hemoptysis) Wheezing Shortness of breath Unintentional weight loss Fatigue  Invasive aspergillosis This is the most severe form of aspergillosis. It occurs when the infection spreads rapidly from the lungs to the brain, heart, kidneys or skin. Invasive aspergillosis occurs only in people whose immune systems are weakened as a result of cancer chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation or a disease of the immune system. Untreated, this form of aspergillosis may be fatal. Signs and symptoms depend on which organs are affected, but in general, invasive aspergillosis can cause:  Fever and chills A cough that brings up blood (hemoptysis) Shortness of breath Chest or joint pain Headaches or eye symptoms Skin lesions  Other types of aspergillosis Aspergillus can invade areas of your body other than your lungs, such as your sinuses.

"Symptoms vary based on the type of seizure. They also can range from mild to severe. Seizure symptoms may include:  Temporary confusion. A staring spell. Jerking movements of the arms and legs that can't be controlled. Loss of consciousness or awareness. Cognitive or emotional changes. They may include fear, anxiety or a feeling that you've already lived this moment, known as deja vu.  Health care providers typically classify seizures as focal or generalized. Seizures are classified based on how and where the brain activity causing the seizure began. If providers don't know how the seizures began, they may classify the seizures as unknown onset. Focal seizures Focal seizures result from electrical activity in one area of the brain. This type of seizure can occur with or without loss of consciousness:  Focal seizures with impaired awareness. These seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness that feels like being in a dream. People having these types of seizures may seem awake but they stare into space and don't respond to their environment. They may perform repetitive movements such as hand rubbing, mouth movements, repeating certain words or walking in circles. They may not remember the seizure or even know that it occurred.  Focal seizures without impaired awareness. These seizures may alter emotions. They also may change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. But the seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness. During these types of seizures, people may suddenly feel angry, joyful or sad. Some people have nausea or unusual feelings that are hard to describe. These seizures may result in trouble speaking and involuntary jerking of a body part such as an arm or a leg. They also may cause sudden sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and seeing flashing lights.   Symptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other disorders of the brain or nervous system. They include migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. Generalized seizures Seizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain from the time they start are called generalized seizures. Different types of generalized seizures include:  Absence seizures. Absence seizures, formerly known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children. Absence seizures typically cause a person to stare into space or make subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. They usually last for 5 to 10 seconds. These seizures may happen up to hundreds of times a day. They may occur in clusters and can cause a brief loss of awareness. Tonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of the muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in the back, arms and legs. People who experience these seizures may lose consciousness and fall to the ground. Atonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control. People having this type of seizure may suddenly fall down or drop their head. Clonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms on both sides of the body. Myoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of the arms and legs. There is often no loss of consciousness. Tonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure. They can cause a sudden loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking. They sometimes cause people to lose control of their bladder or to bite their tongue. They may last for several minutes. Tonic-clonic seizures also may start as focal seizures that then spread to involve most or all of the brain.

"Not all pituitary tumors cause symptoms. Sometimes these tumors are found during an imaging test, such as an MRI or a CT scan, that is done for another reason. If they don't cause symptoms, pituitary tumors usually don't need treatment.

Low amounts of hormones Macroadenomas can limit the pituitary gland's ability to make hormones. When that happens, symptoms may include:  Tiredness or weakness. Lack of energy. Sexual problems, such as problems with erections and less interest in sex. Changes in menstrual cycles. Nausea. Feeling cold. Losing or gaining weight without trying.  High amounts of hormones Functioning pituitary adenomas typically make a large amount of one hormone. That exposes the body to high levels of that hormone. Rarely, a pituitary adenoma may make more than one hormone. The following types of functioning pituitary adenomas cause different symptoms depending on the hormones they make. Pituitary tumors that make adrenocorticotropic hormone Pituitary tumors that make adrenocorticotropic hormone are called corticotroph adenomas. Adrenocorticotropic hormone, also called ACTH, causes the adrenal glands to make the hormone cortisol. ACTH tumors trigger the adrenal glands to make too much cortisol. This causes a condition called Cushing disease. Cushing disease is one cause of Cushing syndrome. ACTH ACTH Cushing disease symptoms include:  Weight gain and fatty tissue deposits around the midsection and upper back. Rounded face. Stretch marks. Thin skin that bruises easily. Thinning of the arms and legs with muscle weakness. Thicker or more visible body hair. Slow healing of cuts, insect bites and infections. Areas of darkened skin. Acne. Changes in menstrual cycles. Sexual problems, including problems with erections and less interest in sex.  Pituitary tumors that make growth hormone Pituitary tumors that make growth hormone also are called growth hormone-secreting tumors or somatotroph adenomas. Too much growth hormone leads to a condition known as acromegaly. Acromegaly can cause:  Changes in facial features, including larger lips, nose and tongue; longer lower jaw; and wide spaces between teeth. Growth of hands and feet. Thicker skin. More sweating and body odor. Joint pain. A deeper voice.  Children and teens who have too much growth hormone might also grow faster or taller than usual. This condition is called gigantism. Pituitary tumors that make luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are also known as gonadotropins. Pituitary tumors that make these hormones are called gonadotroph adenomas. It's uncommon for these adenomas to make too many hormones that then trigger symptoms. Instead, symptoms from these adenomas usually are due to tumor pressure. If symptoms do happen because of too much LH and FSH, they affect women and men differently. LH FSH Symptoms in women may include:  Change in menstrual cycles. Fertility problems. Enlargement of and pain in the ovaries caused by a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.  Symptoms in men may include:  Enlarged testicles. Higher levels of testosterone.  Pituitary tumors that make prolactin These adenomas are called prolactinomas. Too much of the hormone prolactin can lead to a decrease in the body's levels of sex hormones — estrogen and testosterone. Too much prolactin affects men and women differently. In women, too much prolactin might cause:  Irregular menstrual cycles. Lack of menstrual cycles. Milky discharge from the breasts. Breast tenderness. Problems with fertility. Less interest in sex.  In men, too much prolactin can cause a condition called male hypogonadism. Symptoms might include:  Problems with erections. Less interest in sex. Breast growth. Problems with fertility. Less body and facial hair.  Pituitary tumors that make thyroid-stimulating hormone Pituitary tumors that make thyroid-stimulating hormone are called thyrotroph adenomas. They also may be referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting tumors. They cause the thyroid gland to make too much of the hormone thyroxine, also called T-4. That leads to a condition called hyperthyroidism, also known as overactive thyroid disease. Hyperthyroidism can speed up the body's metabolism causing many symptoms. Some of the most common include:  Weight loss. Rapid or irregular heartbeat. Nervousness, anxiety or irritability. Frequent bowel movements. Sweating. Tremor. Sleep problems.

"Signs and symptoms of Noonan syndrome vary greatly among individuals and may be mild to severe. Characteristics may be related to the specific gene containing the mutation. Facial features Facial appearance is one of the key clinical features that leads to a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. These features may be more pronounced in infants and young children, but change with age. In adulthood, these distinct features become more subtle. Features may include the following:  Eyes are wide-set and down-slanting with droopy lids. Irises are pale blue or green. Ears are low-set and rotated backward. Nose is depressed at the top, with a wide base and bulbous tip. Mouth has a deep groove between the nose and the mouth and wide peaks in the upper lip. The crease that runs from the edge of the nose to the corner of the mouth becomes deeply grooved with age. Teeth may be crooked, the inside roof of the mouth (palate) may be highly arched and the lower jaw may be small. Facial features may appear coarse, but appear sharper with age. The face may appear droopy and expressionless. Head may appear large with a prominent forehead and a low hairline on the back of the head. Skin may appear thin and transparent with age.  Heart disease Many people with Noonan syndrome are born with some form of heart defect (congenital heart disease), accounting for some of the key signs and symptoms of the disorder. Some heart problems can occur later in life. Some forms of congenital heart disease associated with this disorder include:  Valve disorders. Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve, the flap of tissue that separates the lower right chamber (ventricle) of the heart from the artery that supplies blood to the lungs (pulmonary artery). It's the most common heart problem seen with Noonan syndrome, and it may occur alone or with other heart defects. Thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). This is abnormal growth or thickening of the heart muscle that affects some people with Noonan syndrome. Other structural defects of the heart. The defects can involve a hole in the wall that separates the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricular septal defect), narrowing of the artery that carries blood to the lungs for oxygen (pulmonary artery stenosis), or narrowing of the major blood vessel (aorta) that carries blood from the heart to the body (aortic coarctation). Irregular heart rhythm. This can occur with or without structural heart abnormalities. Irregular heart rhythm occurs in the majority of people with Noonan syndrome.  Growth issues Noonan syndrome can affect normal growth. Many children with Noonan syndrome don't grow at a normal rate. Issues may include the following:  Birth weight will likely be normal, but growth slows over time. Eating difficulties may result in inadequate nutrition and poor weight gain. Growth hormone levels may be insufficient. The growth spurt that's usually seen during the teenage years may be delayed. But because this disorder causes bone maturity to be delayed, growth sometimes continues into the late teens. By adulthood, some people with Noonan syndrome may have normal height, but short stature is more common.  Musculoskeletal issues Some common issues can include:  An unusually shaped chest often with a sunken sternum (pectus excavatum) or raised sternum (pectus carinatum) Wide-set nipples Short neck, often with extra folds of skin (webbed neck) or prominent neck muscles (trapezius) Deformities of the spine  Learning disabilities Intelligence isn't affected for most people with Noonan syndrome. However, individuals may have:  An increased risk of learning disabilities and mild intellectual disability A wide range of mental, emotional and behavioral issues that are usually mild Hearing and vision deficits that may complicate learning  Eye conditions A common sign of Noonan syndrome is abnormalities of the eyes and eyelids. These may include:  Problems with the eye muscles, such as cross-eye (strabismus) Refractive problems, such as astigmatism, nearsightedness (myopia) or farsightedness (hyperopia) Rapid movement of the eyeballs (nystagmus) Cataracts  Hearing problems Noonan syndrome can cause hearing deficits due to nerve issues or to structural abnormalities in the inner ear bones. Bleeding Noonan syndrome can cause excessive bleeding and bruising due to clotting defects or having too few platelets. Lymphatic conditions Noonan syndrome can cause problems with the lymphatic system, which drains excess fluid from the body and helps fight infection. These problems:  May show up before or after birth or develop in the teenage years or adulthood Can be focused in a particular area of the body or widespread Most commonly cause excess fluid (lymphedema) on the back of the hands or top of the feet  Genital and kidney conditions Many people, especially males, with Noonan syndrome can have problems with the genitals and kidneys.  Testicles. Undescended testicles (cryptorchidism) are common in males. Puberty. Puberty may be delayed in both boys and girls. Fertility. Most females develop normal fertility. In males, however, fertility may not develop normally, often because of undescended testicles. Kidneys. Kidney problems are generally mild and occur in a fairly small number of people with Noonan syndrome.  Skin conditions People with Noonan syndrome may have skin conditions, which most commonly are:  Various problems that affect the color and texture of the skin Curly, coarse hair or sparse hair  When to see a doctor The signs and symptoms of Noonan syndrome can be subtle. If you suspect you or your child may have the disorder, see your primary care doctor or your child's pediatrician. You or your child may be referred to a geneticist or a cardiologist. If your unborn child is at risk because of a family history of Noonan syndrome, prenatal tests may be available.",687.0,"['signs symptoms noonan syndrome vary greatly individuals may mild severe', ' characteristics may specific gene containing mutation', ' facial features facial appearance key clinical features leads diagnosis noonan syndrome', ' features may pronounced infants young children', ' change age', ' adulthood', ' distinct features subtle', ' features may include following:  eyes wide-set down-slanting droopy lids', ' irises pale blue green', ' ears low-set rotated backward', ' nose depressed top', ' wide base bulbous tip', ' mouth deep groove nose mouth wide peaks upper lip', ' crease runs edge nose corner mouth deeply grooved age', ' teeth may crooked', ' inside roof mouth (palate) may highly arched lower jaw may small', ' facial features may coarse', ' sharper age', ' face may droopy expressionless', ' head may large prominent forehead low hairline back head', ' skin may thin transparent age', '  heart disease people noonan syndrome born form heart defect (congenital heart disease)', ' accounting key signs symptoms disorder', ' heart problems can occur later life', ' forms congenital heart disease associated disorder include:  valve disorders', ' pulmonary valve stenosis narrowing pulmonary valve', ' flap tissue separates lower right chamber (ventricle) heart artery supplies blood lungs (pulmonary artery)', "" it's common heart problem seen noonan syndrome"", ' may occur alone heart defects', ' thickening heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)', ' abnormal growth thickening heart muscle affects people noonan syndrome', ' structural defects heart', ' defects can involve hole wall separates lower chambers heart (ventricular septal defect)', ' narrowing artery carries blood lungs oxygen (pulmonary artery stenosis)', ' narrowing major blood vessel (aorta) carries blood heart body (aortic coarctation)', ' irregular heart rhythm', ' can occur structural heart abnormalities', ' irregular heart rhythm occurs majority people noonan syndrome', '  growth issues noonan syndrome can affect normal growth', "" children noonan syndrome don't grow normal rate"", ' issues may include following:  birth weight will likely normal', ' growth slows time', ' eating difficulties may result inadequate nutrition poor weight gain', ' growth hormone levels may insufficient', "" growth spurt that's seen teenage years may delayed"", ' disorder causes bone maturity delayed', ' growth continues late teens', ' adulthood', ' people noonan syndrome may normal height', ' short stature common', '  musculoskeletal issues common issues can include:  unusually shaped chest sunken sternum (pectus excavatum) raised sternum (pectus carinatum) wide-set nipples short neck', "" extra folds skin (webbed neck) prominent neck muscles (trapezius) deformities spine  learning disabilities intelligence isn't affected people noonan syndrome"", ' however', ' individuals may have:  increased risk learning disabilities mild intellectual disability wide range mental', ' emotional behavioral issues mild hearing vision deficits may complicate learning  eye conditions common sign noonan syndrome abnormalities eyes eyelids', ' may include:  problems eye muscles', ' cross-eye (strabismus) refractive problems', ' astigmatism', ' nearsightedness (myopia) farsightedness (hyperopia) rapid movement eyeballs (nystagmus) cataracts  hearing problems noonan syndrome can cause hearing deficits due nerve issues structural abnormalities inner ear bones', ' bleeding noonan syndrome can cause excessive bleeding bruising due clotting defects platelets', ' lymphatic conditions noonan syndrome can cause problems lymphatic system', ' drains excess fluid body helps fight infection', ' problems:  may show birth develop teenage years adulthood can focused area body widespread commonly cause excess fluid (lymphedema) back hands top feet  genital kidney conditions people', ' especially males', ' noonan syndrome can problems genitals kidneys', '  testicles', ' undescended testicles (cryptorchidism) common males', ' puberty', ' puberty may delayed boys girls', ' fertility', ' females develop normal fertility', ' males', ' however', ' fertility may develop normally', ' undescended testicles', ' kidneys', ' kidney problems generally mild occur fairly small number people noonan syndrome', '  skin conditions people noonan syndrome may skin conditions', ' commonly are:  problems affect color texture skin curly', ' coarse hair sparse hair  see doctor signs symptoms noonan syndrome can subtle', ' suspect child may disorder', "" see primary care doctor child's pediatrician"", ' child may referred geneticist cardiologist', ' unborn child risk family history noonan syndrome', ' prenatal tests may available', '']",['noonan syndrome']

Symptoms usually last just a day or two, but occasionally they may last up to 14 days.

"Tuberous sclerosis symptoms are caused by noncancerous growths in parts of the body, most commonly in the skin, brain, eyes, kidneys, heart and lungs. But any part of the body can be affected. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, depending on the size or location of the growths. Although symptoms are different for each person with tuberous sclerosis, they can include:  Skin changes. Skin changes are most common. These include patches of lighter skin and small areas of thickened, smooth or bumpy skin. On the forehead, skin can have raised, discolored areas. Small soft bumps under or around the nails may occur. Growths on the face that start in childhood and look like acne are common. Seizures. Growths in the brain may be linked with seizures. A seizure is often the first symptom of tuberous sclerosis. In small children, a common type of seizure called infantile spasm involves stiffening of the arms and legs and arching the back and head. Problems in thinking, reasoning and learning. Tuberous sclerosis can result in developmental delays. Sometimes it limits the ability to think, reason and learn. Mental health conditions, such as autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), also can occur. Behavior problems. Common behavior problems may include hyperactivity, self-injury or aggression, or issues with social and emotional adjustment. Kidney problems. Growths on the kidneys are common, and more growths may develop with age. Heart issues. Growths in the heart, if present, are usually largest at birth and shrink as a child gets older. Lung problems. Growths that develop in the lungs may cause coughing or trouble breathing, especially with physical activity or exercise. These lung tumors occur more often in females than in males. Eye problems. Growths can appear as white patches on the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye called the retina. These growths usually don't interfere with vision. Dental changes.

"Many people with Chiari malformation have no signs or symptoms and don't need treatment. Their condition is detected only when tests are performed for unrelated disorders. However, depending on the type and severity, Chiari malformation can cause a number of problems. The more common types of Chiari malformation are:  Type 1 Type 2  Although these types are less serious than the rarer pediatric form, type 3, signs and symptoms still can be life disrupting. Chiari malformation type 1 In Chiari malformation type 1, signs and symptoms usually appear during late childhood or adulthood. Headaches, often severe, are the classic symptom of Chiari malformation. They generally occur after sudden coughing, sneezing or straining. People with Chiari malformation type 1 can also experience:  Neck pain Unsteady gait (problems with balance) Poor hand coordination (fine motor skills) Numbness and tingling of the hands and feet Dizziness Difficulty swallowing, sometimes accompanied by gagging, choking and vomiting Speech problems, such as hoarseness  Less often, people with Chiari malformation may experience:  Ringing or buzzing in the ears (tinnitus) Weakness Slow heart rhythm Curvature of the spine (scoliosis) related to spinal cord impairment Breathing problems, such as central sleep apnea, which is when a person stops breathing during sleep  Chiari malformation type 2 In Chiari malformation type 2, a greater amount of tissue extends into the spinal canal compared with that in Chiari malformation type 1. The signs and symptoms can include those related to a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele that nearly always accompanies Chiari malformation type 2. In myelomeningocele, the backbone and the spinal canal don't close properly before birth. Signs and symptoms may include:  Changes in breathing pattern Swallowing problems, such as gagging Quick downward eye movements Weakness in the arms  Chiari malformation type 2 is usually noted with ultrasound during pregnancy. It may also be diagnosed after birth or in early infancy. Chiari malformation type 3 In the most severe type of the condition, Chiari malformation type 3, a portion of the lower back part of the brain (cerebellum) or the brainstem extends through an opening in the back of the skull.

The symptoms of hypothyroidism depend on the severity of the condition. Problems tend to develop slowly, often over several years. At first, you may barely notice the symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue and weight gain. Or you may think they are just part of getting older. But as your metabolism continues to slow, you may develop more-obvious problems. Hypothyroidism symptoms may include:  Tiredness. More sensitivity to cold. Constipation. Dry skin. Weight gain. Puffy face. Hoarse voice. Coarse hair and skin. Muscle weakness. Muscle aches, tenderness and stiffness. Menstrual cycles that are heavier than usual or irregular. Thinning hair. Slowed heart rate, also called bradycardia. Depression. Memory problems.  Hypothyroidism in infants Anyone can get hypothyroidism, including infants. Most babies born without a thyroid gland or with a gland that doesn't work correctly don't have symptoms right away. But if hypothyroidism isn't diagnosed and treated, symptoms start to appear. They may include:  Feeding problems. Poor growth. Poor weight gain. Yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes, a condition called jaundice. Constipation. Poor muscle tone. Dry skin. Hoarse crying. Enlarged tongue. A soft swelling or bulge near the belly button, a condition called umbilical hernia.  When hypothyroidism in infants isn't treated, even mild cases can lead to severe physical and mental development problems. Hypothyroidism in children and teens In general, children and teens with hypothyroidism have symptoms similar to those in adults. But they also may have:  Poor growth that leads to short stature.

"The physical signs and symptoms of anorexia nervosa are related to starvation. Anorexia also includes emotional and behavioral issues involving an unrealistic perception of body weight and an extremely strong fear of gaining weight or becoming fat. It may be difficult to notice signs and symptoms because what is considered a low body weight is different for each person, and some individuals may not appear extremely thin. Also, people with anorexia often disguise their thinness, eating habits or physical problems.

"A child who's being abused may feel guilty, ashamed or confused. The child may be afraid to tell anyone about the abuse, especially if the abuser is a parent, other relative or family friend. That's why it's vital to watch for red flags, such as:  Withdrawal from friends or usual activities Changes in behavior — such as aggression, anger, hostility or hyperactivity — or changes in school performance Depression, anxiety or unusual fears, or a sudden loss of self-confidence Sleep problems and nightmares  An apparent lack of supervision Frequent absences from school Rebellious or defiant behavior Self-harm or attempts at suicide  Specific signs and symptoms depend on the type of abuse and can vary. Keep in mind that warning signs are just that — warning signs. The presence of warning signs doesn't necessarily mean that a child is being abused. Physical abuse signs and symptoms  Unexplained injuries, such as bruises, broken bones (fractures) or burns Injuries that don't match the given explanation Injuries that aren't compatible with the child's developmental ability  Sexual abuse signs and symptoms  Sexual behavior or knowledge that's inappropriate for the child's age Pregnancy or a sexually transmitted infection Genital or anal pain, bleeding, or injury Statements by the child that he or she was sexually abused Inappropriate sexual behavior with other children  Emotional abuse signs and symptoms  Delayed or inappropriate emotional development Loss of self-confidence or self-esteem Social withdrawal or a loss of interest or enthusiasm Depression Avoidance of certain situations, such as refusing to go to school or ride the bus Appears to desperately seek affection A decrease in school performance or loss of interest in school Loss of previously acquired developmental skills  Neglect signs and symptoms  Poor growth Excessive weight with medical complications that are not being adequately addressed Poor personal cleanliness Lack of clothing or supplies to meet physical needs Hoarding or stealing food Poor record of school attendance Lack of appropriate attention for medical, dental or psychological problems or lack of necessary follow-up care  Parental behavior Sometimes a parent's demeanor or behavior sends red flags about child abuse. Warning signs include a parent who:  Shows little concern for the child Appears unable to recognize physical or emotional distress in the child Blames the child for the problems Consistently belittles or berates the child, and describes the child with negative terms, such as ""worthless"" or ""evil"" Expects the child to provide attention and care to the parent and seems jealous of other family members getting attention from the child Uses harsh physical discipline Demands an inappropriate level of physical or academic performance Severely limits the child's contact with others Offers conflicting or unconvincing explanations for a child's injuries or no explanation at all Repeatedly brings the child for medical evaluations or requests medical tests, such as X-rays and lab tests, for concerns not seen during the health care provider's examination  Physical punishment Child health experts condemn the use of violence in any form, but some people still use physical punishment, such as spanking, to discipline their children. While parents and caregivers often use physical punishment with the intention of helping their children or making their behavior better, research shows that spanking is linked with worse, not better, behavior. It's also linked to mental health problems, difficult relationships with parents, lower self-esteem and lower academic performance. Any physical punishment may leave emotional scars.

"The signs of craniosynostosis are usually noticeable at birth, but they become more apparent during the first few months of your baby's life. Signs and severity depend on how many sutures are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. Signs and symptoms can include:  A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected Development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures, with a change in the shape of the head that's not typical  Types of craniosynostosis There are several types of craniosynostosis. Most involve the fusion of a single cranial suture. Some complex forms of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures. Multiple suture craniosynostosis is usually linked to genetic syndromes and is called syndromic craniosynostosis. The term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what sutures are affected. Types of craniosynostosis include:  Sagittal (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that runs from the front to the back at the top of the skull forces the head to grow long and narrow. This head shape is called scaphocephaly. Sagittal craniosynostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis. Coronal. Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures (unicoronal) that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side. It also leads to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side. When both coronal sutures fuse prematurely (bicoronal), the head has a short and wide appearance, often with the forehead tilted forward. Metopic. The metopic suture runs from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head. This head shape is also called trigonocephaly. Lambdoid. Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture, which runs along the back of the head. It may cause one side of a baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side.  Other reasons for a misshapen head A misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of spending too much time lying on one side of the head. This can be treated with regular position changes, or if significant, with helmet therapy (cranial orthosis) to help reshape the head to a more balanced appearance.",253.0,"['signs craniosynostosis noticeable birth', "" apparent first months baby's life"", ' signs severity depend sutures fused brain development fusion occurs', ' signs symptoms can include:  misshapen skull', ' shape depending sutures affected development raised', ' hard ridge affected sutures', "" change shape head that's typical  types craniosynostosis types craniosynostosis"", ' involve fusion single cranial suture', ' complex forms craniosynostosis involve fusion multiple sutures', ' multiple suture craniosynostosis linked genetic syndromes called syndromic craniosynostosis', ' term given type craniosynostosis depends sutures affected', ' types craniosynostosis include:  sagittal (scaphocephaly)', ' premature fusion sagittal suture runs front back top skull forces head grow long narrow', ' head shape called scaphocephaly', ' sagittal craniosynostosis common type craniosynostosis', ' coronal', ' premature fusion coronal sutures (unicoronal) run ear top skull may cause forehead flatten affected side bulge unaffected side', ' leads turning nose raised eye socket affected side', ' coronal sutures fuse prematurely (bicoronal)', ' head short wide appearance', ' forehead tilted forward', ' metopic', ' metopic suture runs top bridge nose midline forehead anterior fontanel sagittal suture', ' premature fusion gives forehead triangular appearance widens back part head', ' head shape called trigonocephaly', ' lambdoid', ' lambdoid synostosis rare type craniosynostosis involves lambdoid suture', ' runs back head', "" may cause side baby's head flat"", ' ear higher ear tilting top head side', ""  reasons misshapen head misshapen head doesn't craniosynostosis"", ' example', "" back baby's head flattened"", ' result spending time lying side head', ' can treated regular position changes', ' significant', ' helmet therapy (cranial orthosis) help reshape head balanced appearance', '']",['craniosynostosis']

"Newborns with PKU initially don't have any symptoms. However, without treatment, babies usually develop signs of PKU within a few months. PKU PKU Signs and symptoms of untreated PKU can be mild or severe and may include: PKU  A musty odor in the breath, skin or urine, caused by too much phenylalanine in the body Nervous system (neurological) problems that may include seizures Skin rashes, such as eczema Lighter skin, hair and eye color than family members, because phenylalanine can't transform into melanin — the pigment responsible for hair and skin tone Unusually small head size (microcephaly) Hyperactivity Intellectual disability Delayed development Behavioral, emotional and social problems Mental health disorders  Severity varies The severity of PKU depends on the type. PKU  Classic PKU. The most severe form of the disorder is called classic PKU. The enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine is missing or severely reduced. This results in high levels of phenylalanine that can cause severe brain damage. Less severe forms of PKU. In mild or moderate forms, the enzyme still has some function, so phenylalanine levels are not as high, resulting in a smaller risk of significant brain damage.  Regardless of the form, most infants, children and adults with the disorder still require a special PKU diet to prevent intellectual disability and other complications. PKU Pregnancy and PKU Women who have PKU and become pregnant are at risk of another form of the condition called maternal PKU. If women don't follow the special PKU diet before and during pregnancy, blood phenylalanine levels can become high and harm the developing baby. PKU PKU PKU Even women with less severe forms of PKU may place their unborn children at risk by not following the PKU diet. PKU PKU Babies born to women with high phenylalanine levels don't often inherit PKU. But a child can have serious problems if the level of phenylalanine is high in the mother's blood during pregnancy. At birth, the baby may have:  PKU  Low birth weight Unusually small head Problems with the heart  In addition, maternal PKU can cause the child to have delayed development, intellectual disability and problems with behavior.",752.0,"[""newborns pku initially don't symptoms"", ' however', ' treatment', ' babies develop signs pku months', ' pku pku signs symptoms untreated pku can mild severe may include: pku  musty odor breath', ' skin urine', ' caused phenylalanine body nervous system (neurological) problems may include seizures skin rashes', ' eczema lighter skin', ' hair eye color family members', "" phenylalanine can't transform melanin — pigment responsible hair skin tone unusually small head size (microcephaly) hyperactivity intellectual disability delayed development behavioral"", ' emotional social problems mental health disorders  severity varies severity pku depends type', ' pku  classic pku', ' severe form disorder called classic pku', ' enzyme needed break down phenylalanine missing severely reduced', ' results high levels phenylalanine can cause severe brain damage', ' severe forms pku', ' mild moderate forms', ' enzyme still function', ' phenylalanine levels high', ' resulting smaller risk significant brain damage', '  regardless form', ' infants', ' children adults disorder still require special pku diet prevent intellectual disability complications', ' pku pregnancy pku women who pku pregnant risk form condition called maternal pku', "" women don't follow special pku diet pregnancy"", ' blood phenylalanine levels can high harm developing baby', ' pku pku pku women severe forms pku may place unborn children risk following pku diet', "" pku pku babies born women high phenylalanine levels don't inherit pku"", "" child can problems level phenylalanine high mother's blood pregnancy"", ' birth', ' baby may have:  pku  low birth weight unusually small head problems heart  addition', ' maternal pku can cause child delayed development', ' intellectual disability problems behavior', '']",['phenylketonuria']

Frostnip doesn't permanently damage the skin. Signs and symptoms of frostbite include:  At first, cold skin and a prickling feeling Numbness Skin that looks red, white, bluish-white, grayish-yellow, purplish, brown or ashen, depending on the severity of the condition and usual skin color Hard or waxy-looking skin Clumsiness due to joint and muscle stiffness Blistering after rewarming, in severe cases  Frostbite is most common on the fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks and chin. Because of skin numbness, you may not realize you have frostbite until someone points it out. Changes in the color of the affected area might be difficult to see on brown or Black skin. Frostbite occurs in several stages:  Frostnip. Frostnip is a mild form of frostbite. Continued cold exposure leads to numbness in the affected area. As your skin warms, you may feel pain and tingling. Frostnip doesn't cause permanent skin damage. Superficial frostbite. Superficial frostbite causes slight changes in skin color. The skin may begin to feel warm — a sign of serious skin involvement. If you treat frostbite with rewarming at this stage, the surface of the skin may appear mottled. And you may notice stinging, burning and swelling. A fluid-filled blister may appear 12 to 36 hours after rewarming the skin. Deep (severe) frostbite. As frostbite progresses, it affects all layers of the skin as well as the tissues that lie below. The skin turns white or blue-gray and you lose all sensation of cold, pain or discomfort in the area. Joints or muscles may stop working. Large blisters form 24 to 48 hours after rewarming. The tissue turns black and hard as it dies.

Signs and symptoms of a brachial plexus injury can vary greatly, depending on the severity and location of the injury. Usually only one arm is affected. Less-severe injuries Minor damage often occurs during contact sports, such as football or wrestling, when the brachial plexus nerves get stretched or compressed. These are called stingers or burners, and can produce the following symptoms:  A feeling like an electric shock or a burning sensation shooting down the arm Numbness and weakness in the arm  These symptoms usually last only a few seconds or minutes, but in some people the symptoms may linger for days or longer.

"A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.

The rash gradually spreads over a period of days. Early symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease. A rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy. A rash Other stage 1 symptoms include:  Fever. Headache. Extreme tiredness. Joint stiffness. Muscle aches and pains. Swollen lymph nodes.  Stage 2 Without treatment, Lyme disease can get worse.  The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease. Stage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:  Many rashes on other parts of the body. Neck pain or stiffness. Muscle weakness on one or both sides of the face. Immune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats. Pain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs. Pain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet. Painful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid. Immune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.  Stage 3 In the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease. In the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite. The type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.

"There are three types of neurofibromatosis, each with different signs and symptoms. Neurofibromatosis 1 Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is usually diagnosed during childhood. Signs are often noticeable at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Signs and symptoms are often mild to moderate, but can vary in severity. Signs and symptoms include:  Flat, light brown spots on the skin (cafe au lait spots). These harmless spots are common in many people. Having more than six cafe au lait spots suggests NF1. They are usually present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After childhood, new spots stop appearing. Freckling in the armpits or groin area. Freckling usually appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds. Tiny bumps on the iris of the eye (Lisch nodules). These harmless nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision. Soft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin (neurofibromas). These benign tumors usually develop in or under the skin, but can also grow inside the body. Sometimes, a growth will involve many nerves (plexiform neurofibroma). Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age. Bone deformities. Abnormal bone development and a deficiency in bone mineral density can cause bone deformities such as a curved spine (scoliosis) or a bowed lower leg. Tumor on the optic nerve (optic glioma). These tumors usually appear by age 3, rarely in late childhood and adolescence, and almost never in adults. Learning disabilities. Impaired thinking skills are common in children who have NF1 but are usually mild. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as a problem with reading or mathematics. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common. Larger than average head size. Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume. Short stature. Children who have NF1 often are below average in height.  Neurofibromatosis 2 Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is much less common than NF1. Signs and symptoms of NF2 usually result from the development of benign, slow-growing tumors in both ears (acoustic neuromas), which can cause hearing loss. Also known as vestibular schwannomas, these tumors grow on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. NF1 NF2 Signs and symptoms generally appear during the late teen and early adult years, and can vary in severity. Signs and symptoms can include:  Gradual hearing loss Ringing in the ears Poor balance Headaches  Sometimes NF2 can lead to the growth of schwannomas in other nerves, including the cranial, spinal, visual (optic) and peripheral nerves. People who have NF2 may also develop other benign tumors. NF2 NF2 Signs and symptoms of these tumors can include:  Numbness and weakness in the arms or legs Pain Balance difficulties Facial drop Vision problems or cataracts  Seizures Headache  Schwannomatosis This rare type of neurofibromatosis usually affects people after age 20. Symptoms usually appear between ages 25 and 30. Schwannomatosis causes tumors to develop on the cranial, spinal and peripheral nerves — but rarely on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. Tumors don't usually grow on both hearing nerves, so people who have schwannomatosis don't experience the same hearing loss as people who have NF2.

"Gender dysphoria might cause adolescents and adults to experience a marked difference between inner gender identity and assigned gender that lasts for at least six months. The difference is shown by at least two of the following:   A difference between gender identity and genitals or secondary sex characteristics, such as breast size, voice and facial hair. In young adolescents, a difference between gender identity and anticipated secondary sex characteristics. A strong desire to be rid of these genitals or secondary sex characteristics, or a desire to prevent the development of secondary sex characteristics. A strong desire to have the genitals and secondary sex characteristics of another gender. A strong desire to be or to be treated as another gender. A strong belief of having the typical feelings and reactions of another gender.  Gender dysphoria may also cause significant distress that affects how you function in social situations, at work or school, and in other areas of life. Gender dysphoria might start in childhood and continue into adolescence and adulthood. Or you might have periods in which you no longer experience gender dysphoria. You might also experience gender dysphoria around the time of puberty or much later in life. Complications Gender dysphoria can affect many aspects of life, including daily activities. People experiencing gender dysphoria might have difficulty in school due to pressure to dress in a way that's associated with their sex assigned at birth or out of fear of being harassed or teased. If gender dysphoria impairs the ability to function at school or at work, the result may be school dropout or unemployment. Relationship difficulties are common. Anxiety, depression, self-harm, eating disorders, substance misuse and other problems can occur. People who have gender dysphoria also often experience discrimination, resulting in stress. Accessing health services and mental health services can be difficult due to fear of stigma and a lack of experienced care providers. Adolescents and adults with gender dysphoria without gender-affirming treatment might be at risk of thinking about or attempting suicide.

Paralysis below the neck, including both arms and legs, is called quadriplegia. Your ability to control your limbs after a spinal cord injury depends on two factors: where the injury occurred on your spinal cord and the severity of injury. The lowest part of your spinal cord that remains undamaged after an injury is referred to as the neurological level of your injury. The severity of the injury is often called ""the completeness"" and is classified as either of the following:  Complete. If all feeling (sensory) and all ability to control movement (motor function) are lost below the spinal cord injury, your injury is called complete. Incomplete. If you have some motor or sensory function below the affected area, your injury is called incomplete. There are varying degrees of incomplete injury.  Additionally, paralysis from a spinal cord injury can be referred to as:  Tetraplegia.

Even though the digestive tract looks normal, it doesn't function as it should. Muscles in the intestines move food from the stomach to the rectum. Normally, they contract and relax in a gentle rhythm that moves the food along in a fairly predictable schedule. But with some people, the muscles in the intestines spasm. That means the contractions are longer and stronger than normal. Those spasms are painful. They also disrupt the movement of food through the intestines. If they slow it down, you become constipated. If they cause it to move through too quickly, you get diarrhea. It's not unusual for people to alternate between the two. Another cause of discomfort for people with IBS results from oversensitive nerve endings in the digestive tract. Small bubbles of gas that wouldn't bother most people might be quite painful for you. Your heightened sensitivity can also lead to swelling and bloating.

"Obsessive-compulsive disorder usually includes both obsessions and compulsions. But it's also possible to have only obsession symptoms or only compulsion symptoms. You may or may not realize that your obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable, but they take up a great deal of time and interfere with your daily routine and social, school or work functioning. Obsession symptoms OCD obsessions are repeated, persistent and unwanted thoughts, urges or images that are intrusive and cause distress or anxiety. You might try to ignore them or get rid of them by performing a compulsive behavior or ritual. These obsessions typically intrude when you're trying to think of or do other things. OCD Obsessions often have themes to them, such as:  Fear of contamination or dirt Doubting and having difficulty tolerating uncertainty Needing things orderly and symmetrical Aggressive or horrific thoughts about losing control and harming yourself or others Unwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects  Examples of obsession signs and symptoms include:  Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched Doubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way Images of driving your car into a crowd of people Thoughts about shouting obscenities or acting inappropriately in public Unpleasant sexual images Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions, such as shaking hands  Compulsion symptoms OCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to perform. These repetitive behaviors or mental acts are meant to reduce anxiety related to your obsessions or prevent something bad from happening. However, engaging in the compulsions brings no pleasure and may offer only a temporary relief from anxiety. OCD You may make up rules or rituals to follow that help control your anxiety when you're having obsessive thoughts. These compulsions are excessive and often are not realistically related to the problem they're intended to fix. As with obsessions, compulsions typically have themes, such as:  Washing and cleaning Checking Counting Orderliness Following a strict routine Demanding reassurance  Examples of compulsion signs and symptoms include:  Hand-washing until your skin becomes raw Checking doors repeatedly to make sure they're locked Checking the stove repeatedly to make sure it's off Counting in certain patterns Silently repeating a prayer, word or phrase Arranging your canned goods to face the same way  Severity varies OCD usually begins in the teen or young adult years, but it can start in childhood. Symptoms usually begin gradually and tend to vary in severity throughout life. The types of obsessions and compulsions you experience can also change over time.

"Memory loss is the key symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Early signs include difficulty remembering recent events or conversations. But memory gets worse and other symptoms develop as the disease progresses.  At first, someone with the disease may be aware of having trouble remembering things and thinking clearly. As symptoms get worse, a family member or friend may be more likely to notice the issues. Brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease lead to growing trouble with: Memory Everyone has memory lapses at times, but the memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease persists and gets worse. Over time, memory loss affects the ability to function at work or at home. People with Alzheimer's disease may:  Repeat statements and questions over and over. Forget conversations, appointments or events. Misplace items, often putting them in places that don't make sense. Get lost in places they used to know well. Eventually forget the names of family members and everyday objects. Have trouble finding the right words for objects, expressing thoughts or taking part in conversations.  Thinking and reasoning Alzheimer's disease causes difficulty concentrating and thinking, especially about abstract concepts such as numbers. Doing more than one task at once is especially difficult. It may be challenging to manage finances, balance checkbooks and pay bills on time. Eventually, a person with Alzheimer's disease may be unable to recognize and deal with numbers. Making judgments and decisions Alzheimer's disease causes a decline in the ability to make sensible decisions and judgments in everyday situations. For example, a person may make poor choices in social settings or wear clothes for the wrong type of weather. It may become harder for someone to respond to everyday problems. For example, the person may not know how to handle food burning on the stove or decisions when driving. Planning and performing familiar tasks Routine activities that require completing steps in order become a struggle. This may include planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game. Eventually, people with advanced Alzheimer's disease forget how to do basic tasks such as dressing and bathing. Changes in personality and behavior Brain changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease can affect moods and behaviors. Problems may include the following:  Depression. Loss of interest in activities. Social withdrawal. Mood swings. Distrust in others. Anger or aggression. Changes in sleeping habits. Wandering. Loss of inhibitions. Delusions, such as believing something has been stolen.  Preserved skills Despite major changes to memory and skills, people with Alzheimer's disease are able to hold on to some skills even as symptoms get worse. Preserved skills may include reading or listening to books, telling stories, sharing memories, singing, listening to music, dancing, drawing, or doing crafts.
